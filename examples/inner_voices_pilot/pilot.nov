eadT: INNER VOICES PILOT
S: by Pedro Braga

== That Rainy Night ==
Where: Zenith Forest
When: 2029-06-21
Summary: Cold open. A faint memory plays. It was a friday. It was raining. And you didn't yet know how much everything was going to change. In that one cold friday night. Intro chyron.

The game opens by showing the logos of the "publishers," against a black screen (like a movie) interspersed with scenes from an important memory. Ominous synthwave music plays.

// This memory is of the event that kickstarted this entire plot. Right now, it's a Chekov's gun to be fired later.

#BGM Overture
#SFX An ambient sound of rain and sirens.

#CHYRON a PEDRO BRAGA production
#CAM Panning right to left.

The twilight shines through the drizzle mist ominously dressing Zenith forest.

[Boy]
It's okay... you're gonna be okay...

#CHYRON made with Godot Engine
#CAM Panning top to bottom.

No no no no... Look at me...

#CHYRON In partnership with Top Hat Studios
#CAM Panning right to left.

Here we can but make up the [[Treehouse]], at night, through the thick rain fog and the red-blue sirens.

Please... please...

The audio cuts to silence, and the game cuts to a black screen, with the lone title in a sans-serif font.

#CHYRON "INNER VOICES"

[&]
Wake up...

#TRANS Cut to black.

== First Day of School ==
Where: Claire's Mind
Summary: We cut to a new scene. Claire is excited to move to a new school and make all sorts of new friends... but things from now on might not go as well as expected.

A black screen lingers for a few dramatic seconds. Then, slowly, calmly, deliberately, a voice is heard uttering a single command.

[The Angel]
WAKE.

// The Angel always speaks in one-word sentences. This is the single word it utters in the entire first episode.

#TRANS Cut.

We see [[Claire]], wearing her signature plain red dress laying on her bed. The early morning sun projects onto her creating a lazy scene. See stays laying down for a second...

...then her alarm sets off, she shoots awake. Annoyed, she slowly raises her hand and slams the clock off the table. It hits the ground with a dry thud. She stays there for a moment then— oh! Claire jumps up, brushes off dust from her red dress, grabs her bag and is good to go.

#BGM Good Morning!

Claire puts her shoes on, brushes her teeth and hair (using different utensils).

She slides down the handrail and finds her father [[Jim]] packing her bag.

[Jim]
(continuing to pack her bag)
One of these days you're going to fall flat on your face.

Claire recomposes herself.

[&]
You'd think if you're so excited you would've gotten up earlier?
Do you wanna be late for your first day of school?

[Claire]
I'm sleeping as much as I can so I can be well-rested.

[Jim]
(fatherly)
Ahhh I see, and then you're gonna get ready in five minutes?

[Claire]
Yeah!

Jim kneels with her packed bag.

[Jim]
Hey, I know it's... it's difficult being in a new place but...
It can be a new start...

[Claire]
(smiling kindly)
Daddy it's okeyyy—
(nodding emphatically)
Yep! I'm gonna make loads of friends and I'll show them all my cards!

[Jim]
Oh, yeah?

[Claire]
I got the rare riranossaurus.

[Jim]
You mean "tyranossaurus"?

[Claire]
No, "riranossaurus" it's what's written in it.

[Jim]
Also you don't have to make all your friends in one day, eh?
You can stagger 'em a litt—

Claire "shoves" the cards in his face. /silly

[Jim]
Hey— what did we talk about— oh wait that IS what's written there.
Huh.

[Claire]
Eheheheh...

Jim hands her now packed bag and deploys a single toast in her mouth, anime-style.
Then, he sends her off.

Little Claire steps outside, only to just witness the bus going off without her.

[Claire]
Bognaddit. Oh well...

#BGM New Horizon BETA

She skips and hums happily on her way to the school, greeting everyone in the way.

On the way there, while you're walking, there will be a one second cutaway where Claire is walking with Andy, Bruno and Rodrick in a dark hallway in the school, all holding flashlights. Before you can process what happened, the game cuts back to little Claire walking and the music resumes.

When she arrives at [[the school]], she stops for a moment to observe the building, awestruck.

#CAM Pan upwards showing the imposing building, stopping to frame the waving canadian flag.
#TRANS Dry cut

#BGM Eerie

Claire walks into the school, unbothered by the strangely narrow corridor.

The corridor doesn't seem to end. As she walks, the walls close in more and more.

At the end of the corridor, two children stand — their faces obscured by some kind of [[scribble]] to which Claire does not react.

[Claire]
(enthusiastically)
Hi! I'm Claire! Do you wanna be friends?

An awkward pause.

[Bully 1]
Is that the new freak kid they were talking about?

[Bully 2]
I heard she walks on walls...

[Claire]
What? That's not—

[Bully 1]
(interrupting)
I heard she eats spiders and bugs

[Bully 2]
Ew! That's gross!

The world begins to "glitch out."

// Claire does not react to the world glitching out. When a character is in The Other Side by dreaming, they won't notice the weirdness of it all until the wake up or go [[lucid dreaming]].

[Claire]
No. No... I'm not a freak! I'm not a monster!
I'm not a witch! I'm not.

Claire brings her hand to her head and starts breathing harder.
The lockers' doors in the corridor begin to flutter open and shut.

[&]
I'm not a freak! I'm not! I'm normal!

Claire makes a big motion with her hands and snaps every locker door open psychically)

[&]
I'm NOT—

#TRANS Smash cut

A few images of different events flash on screen. The flash against Valentino, them going into the school, and a giant pillar of blue light.

#TRANS Smash to black, then fade in slowly.

== The Jumpcut ==
Where: New Horizon/School/Classroom C
Summary: Claire, Andy and Bruno wake up in the aftermath of... something. Their memories are spliced and jumbled, and they're surrounded by bizarre figures. After a few moments in hiding, Andy and Claire decide to step out and try to leave.

Claire slowly opens her eyes, feeling disoriented. An "eee" sound fills her ears. The camera is blurry. There's a lot of dust in the air.

You can barely make out the school patio, its torn ceiling and a hole in the ground. The exposed concrete and torn rebar makes it look like an apocalyptic site.

She sees someone walk toward her, before passing out again.

#TRANS Slow fade out, then smash in.

Claire is in a different room. [[Bruno Brooks|Bruno]] is here hectically trying to dial on his phone, but it doesn't seem to be working.

He turns around to walk away. Claire grunts softly, Bruno jumps at the noise.

[Bruno]
You're awake.

[Claire]
Ugh... ow... my head...

[Bruno]
It's okay, it's okay, take your time.

Bruno walks towards the computer on the teacher's desk and starts pressing buttons on it anxiously.

[&]
(shaking his leg)
This is weird... I'm not getting any signal here...
I'm trying to contact anyone but it doesn't go through... Dang it!

At the player's discretion (APD), Claire gets up and might check out Bruno.

[Bruno]
Uh... hey there...

[Claire]
Are you okay?

[Bruno]
Could be better.
Are YOU okay?

[Claire]
I don't know, man...

Bruno walks over to the far side of the classroom to close the window.

[&]
This thing just won't stay shut, will it...?

Claire pauses for a moment.

[Claire]
(double take)
Wh- Huh???

Claire looks around and calms down.

(APD) she walks toward the door.

[Claire]
Huh... Did you hear that?

[Bruno]
Hear what?
Oh hey— I  wouldn't do that if I were you.
When I got up I saw a *strange figure* outside so I brought you here into the classroom.

[Claire]
A strange figure—?

[Bruno]
(annoyed)
I don't know! It was some— I'm as lost as you are, k?

[Claire]
Just taking a little peek.

Claire starts to open the door very slowly.

[Bruno]
(whispering but also yelling)
What? Don't "take a peek"!

Bruno gets off the computer and gets behind Claire.

[Claire]
(curious)
Huh.

// What Claire is seeing through the door here is one of the glowing cracks of the tear.

[Bruno]
What? What did you see?

[Claire]
There's like a... Hm... How do I put this...

[Bruno]
A WHAT? Let me see.

[Claire]
Shh. Quiet.

Bruno inches the door very slowly and tries to open the door more to see, while Claire tries to push him away.

SUDDENLY! The room's window shoots open, letting in a burst of rain. Bruno and Claire get startled with exclamation speech bubbles over their heads.

#TRANS Cut.

#CAM The camera shows the classroom door from the outside.

A brief pause to let the new environment sink in (and for comedic timing)...

...then the door SHOOTS open! Bruno and Claire come out dashing out of the room.

#BGM Shadows and Horrors

Claire stops in shock at the ghoulish sights of people shrouded in darkness, facing upwards, arms stretched out and floating half a meter off the ground.

Bruno runs into her, startling her into running again.

They run and run trying to avoid the people, ending up in the computer lab, quickly closing the door behind them.

The two of them catch their breaths.

[Claire]
*huff puff*
I—

[Bruno]
**WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT??? DID YOU SEE THAT???**

[Claire]
You're yelling...

[Bruno]
**H- YELLING??? NO SHIT!!!**

An awkward pause.

[Claire]
So... are we gonna stay in this dark room now?

[Bruno]
Any better ideas?

A slight pause.

[Claire]
No...

The light is turned on by [[Andy]], who has his feet on a table looking at a computer.

[Andy]
Let there be light!

[Bruno]
(jumping in surprise)
AAAAAAHHHH!!! HEY DON'T STARTLE ME LIKE THAT WHO DO YOU- Oh, hey Andy.

[Andy]
Heya Bruno. I see you're stranded in school, too.

[Bruno]
Oh yeah. Where was I...

#BGM Friends, I guess!

Bruno starts pacing back and forth.

[&]
Oh dear... Oh crap... Are my sisters alright?
They weren't in their classroom... I'm supposed to pick them up...
What IS going on? Are we...
(stops walking)
Are we on a zombie apocalypse?

[Claire]
(preoccupied)
Hey try to calm—
(confused, chuckling)
W... what?

[Bruno]
DAMN IT. Just today I left my zombie apocalypse kit at home.

[Claire]
B- Bru-
BRUNO!
(preoccupied)
Sorry. What if you sat down for a moment.

[Andy]
Oh, yeah, cm'ere, man.

[Bruno]
Sit down? SIT DOWN???

[Andy]
Are you getting anything out of walking back and forth like a lunatic?

[Bruno]
(angry)
I-

[Andy]
(smiles reassuringly)
Hey. We'll figure this out.
This is probably some weird performance art thingy by the Arts club...

[Bruno]
Did you use to do that in high-school???

[Andy]
No. But now I kinda wish I had the idea...
I can imagine the posters...

Bruno annoyedly mumbles under his breath and frustratedly pulls out a random chair to sit on.
Claire looks down to the ground, sweat still dripping from her cheek.

[&]
Hey, Claire, sit down, too.

The two boys begin messing about in different computers.

// You can inspect what each of them is doing on the computers. Narration will say:

"Bruno is attempting to troubleshoot the internet connection, to hopefully contact someone."

"Andy is playing 'Space Pinball'."

// When you talk to Andy:

[Andy]
You know where they keep those TV-trolley thingies the substitute teachers use?
We could probably watch a mov— oh, you mean to ask what we're gonna do?

[Claire]
Yeah.

[Andy]
Well, between you and me, I think we can just go for it.
Like, the main entrance.
Just... run reeeeally fast.

[Bruno]
(voice crack)
You want to GO BACK OUT THERE????

[Andy]
Oh, I've been in and out there a few times.
A man's gotta pee!

He turns to Claire.

[&]
Oh, yeah, if any of those weirdos gets too close I can just bonk them with this:
(he pulls out an umbrella seemingly out of nowhere)

Bruno stares in disbelief.

[&]
So, what do you think?

[Claire]
(scared)
I... I don't think that's a good idea...

[Andy]
I think there's a vending machine on the way, too...

Claire's stomach rumbles.

[Claire]
M— maybe if we go really quietly?

[Bruno]
(mumbling)
What? Are you serious?

[Claire]
(scared, shrugging)
I can't say no to chips...

[Bruno]
(incredulous)
You two are idiots.

Andy stands up and walks with Claire to the computer lab's door.

[Andy]
On the count of three. Any movement and we bonk them on the head.

Claire nods and readies herself.

[&]
One... Two...

#BGM (silence)
#TRANS Cut

Slight pause.

Claire and Andy burst out of the room, ready to attack whatever they run into. The battle music starts and then "derails" like a paused tape cassette.

[Andy]
(doing fighting poses with Claire)
HIYAAA!!!!!

The two of them stand still for a moment, realising the previously haunted corridor was now empty.

[Andy]
(shrugging)
Maybe they went away to take a nap?

Claire does not respond.

== The Aftermath ==
Summary: While walking around, Claire and Andy find a strange, glowing hole in the ground. The school patio shows signs of a struggle. Something happened in this place. Something really wrong. After getting the key, they are ready to leave, but they get cornered by the Twisted and Claire runs away, accidentally falling into the tear.

#BGM The Aftermath

(At player's discretion) The two of them walk towards the exit, still apprehensive of any surprises. Claire pulls on the entrance door. It's locked.

[Andy]
Booger. Hm...

[Claire]
I'd assume they keep a spare key in the Principal's office.

[Andy]
Good thinking.

(APD) Claire and Andy walk together back into the hallways.

(APD) Claire checks out the vending machine.

[Andy]
Okay, I have one singular dollar.
Do youuu want the [[Nacho Chips]] or the [[Luna Cola]]?

%PROMPT "Nacho Chips", "Luna Cola"

Andy pays for whatever you picked and gives it to you.

[Andy]
There, m'lady.

(APD) The two of them continue to walk until they run into a patio, where all the previously floating entities seem to have gathered on the floor. They are standing still, staring at their feet, unmoving.

At the middle of the patio, there's a deep, long hole, like something with a claw tore a wound into the plane of the floor.

[Andy]
Told you they were sleeping.

[Claire]
What is this hole...

[Andy]
Eh, it's just a hole.

Claire looks at hole in the ground intensely.

[Andy]
(serious)
I just want to get out of there before this whole building collapses or something.

Claire continues looking at the hole. Andy chuckles.

[Andy]
(smiling)
You think it's a zombie apocalypse too?

[Claire]
Huh?
Oh, I don't know what to think, man...

[Andy]
Check this out.

Andy gets a crumbled paper from his pocket.

[Andy]
Paper.

He throws it at one of the people's heads, to Claire's exhasperation.

[Claire]
!!!

The person continues imobile.
Andy looks at Claire and shrugs.

[Andy]
I think it's aliens.
Aliens sprouted from the Earth's core and replaced all the students with doppelgangers.
Either that or it's theater club rehearsal.
Or like a prank or something.

[Claire]
Something tells me it's not a PRANK.

%IF (APD) Taking a step towards the people.

[Claire]
They look like they're hypnotized...

[Andy]
(worried)
Hey, don't get too close, though.

%FINALLY (APD) They take a step.

[Claire]
Wait, if they've come from Earth they're not aliens then.

[Andy]
Let's just keep walking.

(APD) Claire and Andy head upstairs, where the Principal's office is.

[Claire]
That... sound again...
From downstairs...

Claire looks around.

[Andy]
What are you talking about?

[Claire]
It's like... Sorry, it sounded like my name...?

[Andy]
Hey, let's uh keep going.

Claire taps the Principal's door.

[Andy]
Huh? It's locked?
(smiling)
Step aside, I have a trick.

[Claire]
You can pick locks???

[Andy]
No.

Andy kicks down the door, which crashes on the far wall with a large thud.

[&]
There we go.

Claire looks at him silently with a wide mouth, then shakes her head and enters the room.

#TRANS Slide

[Andy]
Now where would a key be.

(APD) Claire walks around the room.

// If you interact with the TV trolley here.

[Andy]
Oh, look, there it is.
(winking)
If you just found some cool tapes, we could watch a movie instead of escaping.

[Claire]
(smiling)
Har har.

// When interacting with the drawers.

She opens a few drawers, and in one of them she finds a keychain.

[Claire]
I got it.

Claire brandishes the keychain in the air.

[Andy]
Oh, give that to me, let me see.

Claire pockets the key. Narration reads "'Principal's Keys' was added to your KEY items."

// There's a subtle UI gag where there's a normal items section, a KEY items and then an IMPORTANT items. The KEY items section is exclusively for KEYs.

// This interaction in particular teaches you to _use_ items on specific things. You must _use_ the key on Andy to progress.

[Andy]
Hmm... Yes... Yes... Looks like keys alright.

Claire begrudgingly lets out a chuckle. Andy seems somewhat relieved about that.

[Andy]
(phew)
How are you feeling?

[Claire]
Me? I don't know...

[Andy]
You look awful.

[Claire]
(smiling)
Is that how you approach women? Not really a smooth talker...

[Andy]
No, you're shaking.

[Claire]
Yeah this is...
This is really freaking me out...

[Andy]
Can I Check you?

[Claire]
Uh... sure.

Andy approaches Claire, puts his hands on her shoulder and closes his eyes.
The HP/DP gauge appears, showing Claire with 3 HP and 0 DP.
The bullet board appears around Claire, showing her SOUL and an x-ray of Claire underneath.

// Arrows will appear, indicating to the player that you can move.
// You'll be able to move as the dialogue goes on.

[Andy]
Oh my god... what happened to you?
Even your SOUL looks weary.

[Claire]
...

[Andy]
I'm feeling tired for some reason, so it'll take a minute.

Andy holds Claire's hand and starts healing her.

[Claire]
Ugh...

[Andy]
Am I hurting you?

[Claire]
No, ugh... my head hurts...

[Andy]
Let me see...
Just close your eyes for a moment, will ya?

Andy starts to heal her head. Suddenly...

Claire closes her eyes. In her mind's eye, though poorly, she manages to recall a memory.

#TRANS Slowly fade out, then in.

[Andy]
...
You know, uh...
Bruno's neurotic ass isn't here...
So I should probably acknowledge it now...

A brief pause.

[&]
(scared)
This... IS freaking weird, isn't it???

[Claire]
Huh?

[Andy]
(exasperated, but quietly)
I'm playing it cool, but...
Do you... remember... like...
Getting here?

[&]
It's like— at some point I was riding a bike, looking for something, you called me on the phone...
And then, suddenly, like... like a jump cut, there I am in the patio...

// The last thing he remembers is being called by Claire during an event that's revealed in [[Episode 04]].

[&]
(preoccupied)
Actually...
What did you call me for, anyways?

[Claire]
I... huh? I don't remember calling you?

[Andy]
What do you remember— what's the LAST thing you remember?

[Claire]
I think I remember...
Uhhhhhhh............

[Andy]
(confused, smiling)
Hey... um... what's... your name?

[Claire]
I DO remember my name.

[Andy]
What's MY name?

[Claire]
It's Mr. Milkshakerrr—

[Andy]
(smiling)
I'm not living that one down am I?

[Claire]
Wait!

Claire brings her hands to her chin, trying to make sense of her memories.

[&]
I vaguely remember... we coming to the school...
We were looking for something...

[Andy]
I guess...
We fucked around and found out, huh?

[Claire]
Maybe... it's a...
An explosion— Like, a gas leak?
You know, with that big hole in the ground...

[Andy]
Like... spontaneous?
Well... it would explain the disorientation...

[Claire]
(smirking)
Hehe...
Are we detectives or what?

The two of them get out of the room, feeling a bit more relaxed.

[&]
(smiling)
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?
Bruno is gonna look so stupid when we come back, hehehe...

Andy takes a step forward.

[&]
We'll just go get Bruno and then leave.
Perfect plan, what could go wr—

[Claire]
(wincing)
Don't say that, though!

[Andy]
Don't say what?
"What could go wrong?"

Claire looks at him silent. He looks at her with a smug expression while wiggling his eyebrows.

[&]
Hey, relax. It's fine.
(smiling reassuringly)
Hey... it's fine.

[Andy]
(remembers something)
Huh... the lab... you know that psychic research lab in town—

[Claire]
I don't want to know what's happening, I want to get out of here.

[Andy]
O... okay...
So let's go.

[Claire]
Yeah.

After Claire takes a single step forward, the bell goes off with a loud, echoing ring.

[Andy]
(smacks lips)
okay

The strange creatures start to PHASE THROUGH THE FLOOR from below, the lights faltering as they do so. They approach the bell eerily, getting closer to Andy and Claire.

[Claire]
(absolutely exhasperated)
AAAAAARH!!!

// Make sure to sell the surprise and horror of seeing a person phase through the floor.

#BGM Panic

[Andy]
(suddenly serious)
What the— Hey, that's— stay away!

// When perceiving real danger, Andy locks in, being protective of Claire.

Claire looks petrified at the faceless humanoid creatures approaching her. She starts to sweat and breathe funny.

[&]
(keeping Claire behind him, holding his umbrella out)
Claire? Are you alright?
Snap out of it! Come on, we can handle this!
This is not time for freezing!

Claire stares blankly past Andy...

[Claire]
I'm...

A figure approaches Andy and he swings the umbrella, dealing a blow on it from a distance (5 damage).

[Andy]
(serious, yelling)
LEAVE US ALONE!!!
(turns to Claire)
Claire? Claire!

Claire takes a step back and looks at her feet.

[Claire]
I'm... I'm sorry!

Claire bolts away, running away from the fight as fast as she can. When she reaches the lower floor, she runs into the edge of the tear and stops to not fall into, not before getting a glimpse of its depth. She freezes, as if in a trance, seemingly mesmerised by it.

Flashes of the nightmare school (the same location from the dream at [[Nightmare]]) show on screen. Children's faces overlayed atop the monsters' around the tear.

[Claire]
This... no...

The strange hum emanates from the tear.
Claire's eyes are filled with the glow from the tear.

The flashes become more intense. Trippy graphics replace the overworld background.
Claire hyperventilates.
The music crescendoes and suddenly cuts.

#TRANS Cut to black.

== Shallow Wound ==
Summary: Claire wakes up inside the tear and runs as fast as she can from the entranced children. She hides away in the bathroom, lacking the courage to jump from the window. Someone enters the bathroom, she thinks she's a goner... and then...

We stay a moment in darkness.

#CAM The camera starts upside down and out of focus, then slowly rotates and focuses on Claire in sync with the synthwave music emerging from a low pass filter (muffled) effect.

#BGM Extremely Necessary Tension

Claire is laying down on the floor. A small black cat with big yellow eyes softly licks her awake.

#SAVE The game is saved here.

She wakes up and looks at the cat. It stares back for a moment, then hops away.

(APD) Claire gets up slowly and looks around. Anxious music comes in as she starts to powerwalk exasperatedly. As she walks, she sees distorted school hallways which wind and bend in unnatural ways. The previously faceless humanoids now look human, familiar.

From within the corridor, an ominous yet comforting voice hums and calls Claire's name.

// Actually, these are all people that play a role in the story later! [[Lily]], [[Guilherme]], [[Rodrick]], [[Tim]], [[Nadia]], etc.

// As Claire walks by, the HP meter pops up. No DP meter yet.

Bullets swirl around you, not exactly aiming at you, but you can be hit and receive 2 or 3 damage.

// Dying here just restarts the section from the save point. It's low stakes.

At the end of the corridors Claire sees a bathroom door, from below which a turquoise light glows and a comforting tune plays, and enters it. The room is chaotic and trippy, safe for a single mirror on the left. She's breathing funny.

[Claire]
Aaaaah!!!

Claire lets out a sigh of desperation. She looks at herself in the mirror.

[&]
What the hell is going on...
(thinking)
Try to remember...

Claire does effort to remember. Two memories flash on screen, one of the blue beam emerging from the top of the school.

[&]
Ugh!!!

With time, Claire starts breathing more calmly. She sits at the cold bathroom floor. As she calms down, the background fades back into focus, revealing the current room is the school bathroom.

From one of the stalls the cat emerges and brushes against her, mildly startling Claire.

#SAVE The game is saved here.

[Claire]
(with a soft voice)
Oh, you're a good kitty aren't you. Are you lost?

The cat gazes into her with its big yellow eyes.

[&]
Me too, kitty. Guess we'll be stuck here for a while, huh...
I... don't know what's going on.
None of this is normal...

Claire looks around.

[&]
(jokingly)
You wouldn't happen to know a way out, would you?

The cat jumps off her lap and then jumps through the bathroom window.

[&]
Oh, If only I were the size of a small cat.

Claire gets up and close to the window. She stands on her toes trying to look through it.

(APD) Claire can move around the bathroom. You can pick up a bucket (one of those cleaning ones) and put it by the window to try and climb out.

Looking out of the window, Claire hesitates...

[Claire]
Oh, that's high up...

%PROMPT "Jump", "Step Down"

You can choose to jump or step down. If you do choose to jump:

Claire looks at the floor from up there for a moment.

[Claire]
Yeah, it's not happening.

Claire steps down from the bucket and into the bathroom.
Suddenly, something starts to knock at the door very intensely.

Claire enters one of the stalls and closes the door.

Something walks into the bathroom, the shadows creeping from under the stall door.

She closes her eyes and attempts to not cry or make any noise.
#CAM Everything goes dark except Claire, the toilet and the stall door.

Then... huh... the noise is... gone?

She opens her eyes, yet everything is still dark.

(APD) She opens the stall door but now everything looks completely dark outside.

== Mystery Encounter ==
Summary: Exiting the bathroom stall, she's in a supernatural darkness. She's cornered by someone, oh no! Welp, you've been got! That's The Mystery Kid, incurable prankster and your saviour in times of despair — they offer Claire an all paid vacation trip to Hearthaven, away from the dangers of the world.

As she looks around, there is nothing: no ceilings, no walls, no sky. Claire takes a few steps forward, each of them echoing into the emptiness.

(APD) As she walks and interacts, she can feel strange things that feel "soft" like a chair, or brick walls. Eventually she takes some invisible steps upwards an elevation of some sort.

Then, a voice pierces through the shadow and give the poor woman chills.

[Mysterious Voice]
Cease.

[&]
You have dwelled into a realm beyond your permission or comprehension, child.

[&]
This transgression will cost you...
(with a dramatic pause)
Your SOUL.

A circle of flames form around here, exhibiting her SOUL in plain sight, as well as the HP counter.

[&]
Farewell.

The flames inch closer and closer to her petrified self, nearly hitting her.

Then, suddenly, the lights turn on, revealing [[The Mystery Kid]] and [[Pierre]] (the cat) sitting at the host's desk of the set for a late night show!!!

An audience out of frame laughs for a whole six seconds.

[Pierre]
You were right, that WAS funny.

[The Mystery Kid]
Funny? This was hilarious! The look in her face!

// TMK is the previously mysterious voice and such
// Also they speak with the intonation of a 1960s game show host

[Claire]
(still out of breath)
Wait... what?

[Pierre]
She was shaking in her boots!!!

[Claire]
HOW OLD ARE YOU? TWELVE Oh— you ARE just a little kid.

[The Mystery Kid]
Sure!

[Claire]
You almost gave me a heart attack! Who even ARE you? Is...
(breathing)
Do you study here... Huff... Oh boy...
Where are your parents?

[The Mystery Kid]
Hey! Shhh—! Get ready, we're about to go live!

[Claire]
Huh?

A stagehand pushes Claire toward the guest's couch. Her sprite moves comedically by spinning in its axis in place until he falls sitting on the couch. The opening theme for the show plays, culminating in the lights around the stage lighting up. We're live!

#BGM The Mystery Kid

[The Mystery Kid]
...and Good Evening, folks!

[&]
Welcome to the premiere of our incredible new evening programme: Theeeee Mystery Chat!
Please do give a hand to our lovely first ever guest: Claire H. Carter!

The audience cheers.

[Pierre]
I wonder what the H stands for.

[The Mystery Kid]
Think it stands for "Helicopter"?

The audience laughs.

[Claire]
It... uh... stands for "Hanako"... but wh—

[The Mystery Kid]
Say, Claire, what's it like to be you?

%PROMPT "Scary", "Confusing"

[The Mystery Kid]
Oh, the teen age — confusing times... your body is changing... hormones are raging...

[Claire]
Huh? I'm twenty years old... I mean... Is...
(looks around)
Is this on television???
IS— IS THIS A FREAKING PRANK SHOW?????

[The Mystery Kid]
(cackling)
HAHAHA! Claire, you're killing me!

They take off their hat and clean it with the edge of their sleeve.

[&]
Look...

The Mystery Kid puts their hat back on and pauses for a moment.

[The Mystery Kid]
You most likely have noticed that everything out there is kinda...
Let's say, different. Gnarly, even!
It's all a horrendous shade of dark blue, for one, who signed off on THAT renovation?

[Claire]
I've... uh... noticed that...

[The Mystery Kid]
I dig the glow-in-the-dark plants but the ominous floating twisted teenagers are a bit of a stylistic clash, aren't they... Not really into that, no.

[Claire]
Teenagers...?

[The Mystery Kid]
(interrupting Claire loudly)
Oh, this is all because of yesterday.
Don't you... remember?
Something happened that broke the world along with everyone's minds.
Clawed a tear in the sacred fabric.
Got the students all... floaty... drifty... T-posing...

[&]
It IS your job to put that all back together, of course.

[Claire]
Huh??? Me???
I'm not going back in there!

[The Mystery Kid]
Well, I'd do it, but...
battling horrible monsters, solving deadly puzzles, saving your friends, and determining the fate of the world?
I'm just a little kid — that's grown up business, innit?

Audience laughs softly.

[The Mystery Kid]
Plus, you did do a quite good job up to here, didn't ya?
You didn't even die once.

[Claire]
I... I don't know what's happening. 
I feel if anything we oughta be calling the police for...

Claire stops to think for a moment.

[&]
Though I'm not sure the police even would know what to make of this...
Maybe... the firefighters???

The audience laughs.
Claire looks again at the audience.

[Claire]
(mumbling)
wheres that laughter coming from theres no one there

[The Mystery Kid]
Yeah this won't do.

The child raises their right hand and all the lights cut off. Claire looks around.

[Claire]
Weren't we live?

[The Mystery Kid]
Oh, no, the live show is pre-recorded.
We wouldn't want our pilot to be an impromptu disaster, would we?
Speaking of which:

A slight pause.

[&]
Come on, Claire...

Claire looks forlorn.

[&]
Hmm. Just what I feared. You really do seem to have no recollection of the previous events that led to the current situation.
This school place isn't doing you much good either.
(they snap their fingers)
Hey, you're looking for a safe place to rest, devoid of mortal danger, I imagine?

[Claire]
Oh, that would be... I'd really like that...

[The Mystery Kid]
Oh, well, I know JUST the place to put you.

The kid jumps onto their table in excitement and gestures at Claire.

[&]
I know a place... a place away from all the mess of the world.
I can get you there, you take five and then we talk more about it all.

[Claire]
A safe place, huh...
I'd like that.

[The Mystery Kid]
(winking)
Brilliant! That's the SPIRIT, darling!

They fall down from the table, ending up sitting at its edge. They assume a more serious expression.

[&]
So, let's make it official.
I'll bring you to this secret haven, and then you'll consider helping me out. Not a commitment, just... consider.
Do we have a **deal**?

They cross their legs and stick out their hand which lights on fire as they say 'deal'. The room becomes darker to frame the two of them. Claire hesitates.

// The game prompts you to make the deal or not, but if you choose not, Claire just says it's because of the fire:

[The Mystery Kid]
What's the holdup? Afraid of a handshake?

[Claire]
Your hand's on fire.

[The Mystery Kid]
It's. It's. It's magic fire. It's fine.

%PROMPT 'Deal', 'Deal'.

[Claire]
Okay.

Claire hesitantly shakes their hand. The Mystery Kid gazes into here eyes seriously for a second. Then, the light comes back and they go back to laughing and joking.

[The Mystery Kid]
Okay so this handshake has zero legal binding so you gotta sign this contract.
(they flash open a contract)
Got a pen on you?

[Claire]
No.

[The Mystery Kid]
Are you suuuure?
(winking)
Check your inventory.

(APD) Player checks the inventory. There is no pen. They close the inventory.

[The Mystery Kid]
Yep. Looks like you really don't have a pen.
You can use mine though.
(they lay the contract on the table)
Sigh here... and here...
(they point to places in the contract as Claire is signing...)
Okay, Claire, you're terrific!

They roll the contract back carefully, then toss it out of frame with a swift motion.

[&]
Hey!
(snap)
No need for frowning now. You'll be back home before you can count to three.
Just, uh, don't start counting now.

[Claire]
(trying to put her thoughts in order)
Are all those people really... what happened to them...?

[The Mystery Kid]
Claire, love, don't be getting stage fright right now.
You're my casting choice — if I believe in you, that means you should believe in yourself too.

[&]
Also, the talking cat here, Pierre, will be assisting you throughout this journey.

[Pierre]
What? Me? Do I really have to?

[The Mystery Kid]
(without diverting his gaze to him)
Absolutely.

[Pierre]
(not really bothered)
Sure.

[The Mystery Kid]
So, I'll leave ya two to it.
Aaaaand remember: we're all counting on you. No pressure.

[Claire]
Well, I—

[The Mystery Kid]
Break a leeeeeg!

#TRANS Smash cut

== The Portal ==
Where: Zenith Forest
Summary: Claire walks through the sombre forest, trying to find her way out. She follows a small black cat into the woods and down the creeks until she sees an abandoned treehouse. When she opens its door she's surprised by a portal to another world.

Claire stands around in the moonlit forest, just outside of the school. You can still see some of the rubble around.

Pierre stands near her.

[Claire]
Oh man. That was something.
Huh? How did I...
Oh...
(thinking)
Did any of that right now really happen?

She turns at the cat beside her, which stares back at her in silence.
After a moment to readjust, she begins walking forward.

[Claire]
Alright... I should... get into the city and then...
I should probably notify the people at MIND...
I guess they'll be useful for something after all...

Claire makes an expression of annoyance. Then she looks at Pierre.

[Claire]
You know, for one moment I could swear I'd seen you talk...

Pierre walks into the forest.

(APD) Claire follows him.

As Claire walks, a peaceful atmosphere accompanies her, a silence that isn't quite silent, but blends the noises of rustling leaves, a small creek nearby, bugs in the grass, and occasionally... the haunting echo of a call from within the woods.

#BGM Zenith

[Claire]
More walking. Radical.

Claire continues walking forward, quietly exploring the dark forest.

// In the way, you'll occasionally run into these big branches that you need to smash to get through. Smashing it uses the same minigame as the "FIGHT" action in battle, so this is a tutorial somewhat.

[Claire]
Where are we going?

Pierre lets out a soft meow and bolts in between the trees. Claire picks up her pace and soon she finds a curious path. Very tensely, she walks over a big trunk laid down as a bridge over the creek. And then she finds herself in a clearing in the forest.

// Wonder if people will recognise the treehouse from the [[#Setting_The_Tone|first scene]].

Moonlit at the clearing's far wall sits a strange treehouse. Its entrance faces her, enticingly. Pierre effortlessly jumps into the balcony and enters the house opening the door, but not fully.

[Claire]
(intrigued)
Hm...

(APD) Claire looks up to the sky then takes a step forward. She climbs the treehouse's rope ladder and carefully opens the door, peeking inside.

Inside the treehouse, instead of, well, the inside of a treehouse, there's a long cylindrical tunnel and a glow-in-the-dark ambiance. A strange hum echoes throughout it, calling Claire.

#CAM The camera frames the corridor from the side so we can see its length, and Claire peeking in the right of the frame.

Claire takes her head out. Birds chirping return. Claire puts her head back in. Ominous sound. She repeats this two more times, then does a double blink.

#CAM The camera does follow her point of view as she puts her head in and out, in comedically jarring fades.

[Claire]
Huh... This looks like a portal to another world...
(thinking)
What is this...

Claire crawls into the corridor, leaving the door open. She walks a few feet: the door closes. She looks behind her, but does not bother to comment. Claire walks further towards the end of the narrow corridor. In contrast to the corridor of [[#First_Day_of_School|the initial nightmare]], this one widens as she gets further.

At the end of the corridor there is a curtain. Claire puts her hands on it.

#TRANS A campy (80s) radial transition.

Claire steps out of the curtains, which close behind her.
She opens her mouth in awe of the sight before her.

#CAM The shot frames her face, so the audience doesn't get to see what she sees yet.

Claire walks down in frame, forward toward the edge of the cliff whe walked onto. She grabs the handrails still in awe.

#CAM As she walks down in frame, the camera continues to pan down past the cliff edge and then around the city.

Music starts to swell with a magic orchestral sound.

#BGM An Other World

#CAM As the camera pans, the resolution of the frame slowly grows from NTSC 4:3 to a modern 16:9. The camera lands back on Claire after it all, the screen now widened, as Claire's mind.

When we see Claire again, her form has changed to a younger one, with her classic red dress and a bandage on her cheek.

Chyrons appear overlayed on the shot where the camera lands on Claire, framing her, and in sync with the music's beautiful final jazzy chords.

#CHYRON Pilot

#CHYRON Episode One (Part I)

#CHYRON Into The Other Side

== In Hearth A Haven ==
Where: Hearthaven
Summary: In The Other Side, Claire is amazed at the sights of the city. The inhabitants quickly take notice of the foreigner and receive her warmly. The adults are unsure of what to do next, and she's summoned to the Mayor's Office.

Claire remains looking at the city for a moment. She stands still, finally allowing herself to calm down. Pierre jumps onto the handrail and she pets him without moving her gaze.

#SAVE Game Saved.

Pierre glances at the lit city for a moment, then looks back at Claire.

[Pierre]
(looking at her starstruck face)
If I could experience this for the first time again...
You're lucky you get that.

[Claire]
Huh—
(she turns to him, her speech finally comfortable and not tense or confused)
Okay, so you CAN talk. But... you couldn't talk outside???

[Pierre]
I can talk all the time.
YOU can only understand me here.

Pierre walks in front of her, sassily but softly hitting her in the face with its tail. Claire ponders for a moment.

[Claire]
What is this pl—
Is this place real?

[Pierre]
As real as every thought you've thought of, and every dream you've dreamt of.

[Claire]
So... not real?

[Pierre]
(dismissively)
If that's what you make of that.

Pierre jumps from the handrail onto the ground and down the stairs that lead to the city.

(APD) Claire jumps onto a floating biscuit in the milk river and drifts down the stream towards the city.

As the walks into the city, the people look at her with intrigue. She feels a bit uncomfortable with the sudden attention.

When she reaches the main street, a [[Evelyn|small child]] walks into frame following a ball she dropped. She grabs the ball and looks up to the stranger before her, then she drops the ball (and drops her jaw).

[Claire]
Um... Hi?

[Evelyn]
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

And then she runs out of frame.

(APD) Claire walks more. Talking to the locals will have them be murmuring at your sight. "It can't be..." "Is that really a..." etc.

The mayor's assistant, Becky, steps out of the mayor's office holding a tea kettle.
She gazes up at Claire, and drops her jaw (and the kettle) with a jarring CRASH!

Then she slowly retreats into her building.

[Claire]
(weirded out)
...

(APD) Claire continues walking until she reaches the village fountain bridge.

She takes the initiative of sitting down. She's cold.

There, she sees Evelyn shaking her arms in heightened emotion, telling two other kids ([[Erica]] and [[Enzo]]) about something. Claire can just about make it out.

[Evelyn]
You gotta come! You GOTTA *see* it!!!

[Enzo]
Hey, hey, lay it out already!

[Evelyn]
No! You're not gonna believe me if I *tell* you! Come see them!

[Enzo]
Them who???

Evelyn grabs Enzo's hand and pulls him toward the right, but then sees Claire is Right There.

[Evelyn]
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

[Claire]
(thinking)
What is so shocking about me???

Erica leaves to the left.

[Enzo]
A... a foreigner...?

[Evelyn]
A foreigner? Not just any foreigner! I can feel they're special...

Erica returns and gives Claire a blanket, then a cup of tea.

[Enzo]
(too close)
They do look good for a foreigner.

[Claire]
What's that supposed to mean...

[Erica]
Her voice is nice...

[Claire]
(smiling)
Hmm...

[Evelyn]
(sniffs her hair)
They smell good, too!

[Claire]
(serious)
Hmm...

[Evelyn]
I swear there's something about them that's special.

[Enzo]
Oh, uh, Evelyn, did you get the ball?

[Evelyn]
Oh. My ball. I oughta retrieeeeeve it!

Enzo and Evelyn leave the frame for a moment.

[Erica]
So...
(trying to sound cool)
Come here often?

[Claire]
Huh. No this is literally my first time in this... uh...

[Erica]
Oh.
Eh...
Ya... got a name, foreigner?

[Claire]
Claire.

[Erica]
(surprised)
A girl...
(playing it cool)
My name's Erica, by the way.

[Claire]
(looking around)
Uh... Okay.

[Erica]
So...
Uh...
(finger guns)
Atoms, right?

[Claire]
Huh?

Evelyn comes back.

[Evelyn]
You know how to play ontoball?

Enzo comes back.

[Enzo]
(monotonely)
It's a game where you free the ball of metaphysical constraints and try to guess what it settles into.

[Claire]
what

[Erica]
I don't think they have "ontoball" on her side.

Becky comes into the bridge, walking awkwardly. She crouches and pants for a bit, fixes her hair and glasses, then addresses them.

[Becky]
Apologies for earlier, young hero, I... huff puff...

[Evelyn]
Hero?

Evelyn turns around. Then she beams in recollection.

[Erica]
(surprised recollection)
The murals...

[Enzo]
Oh, wowzers! I can't believe it!

[Evelyn]
(speaking fast)
Oh my god, how many people have you guided?
Wait no— how's it like to have a key? Do you have powers?
Is your hair always wet? Are those your powers?

[Erica]
(perplexed)
A hero...

[Becky]
Hey there kids, don't harrass the human with questions, alright?
Excuse me young one, the town's mayor requests your attendance to his office.

[Enzo]
(surprised)
"H"... "Human"?

[Becky]
I'm afraid this meeting is of utmost urgency. Will you accompany me?

[Claire]
I guess so...?

The kids say "awww" in unison. Claire and Becky leave to the right.

#CAM The camera lingers on Erica for a moment.

Evelyn and Enzo leave to the left with their heads down.
Erica stays looking at Claire with dreamy eyes.

#TRANS Campy 80s lateral wipe.

[Becky]
Just a heads up, the mayor can be a somewhat intense negotiator.

[Claire]
Uhh... Okay?!

[Becky]
Alright.

They enter the office.

#TRANS Slide

== Political Favour ==
Where: Hearthaven/Mayor Office
Summary: The town adults discuss the presence of the hero in her state. Claire offers to fetch "The Ancient Scroll" in time for the storytelling ceremony.

#BGM Politics

The [[Manuel McMayor|mayor]] sits in his chair, scribbling on some paperwork. There are mountains of paper all across his desk and also the floor.

[McMayor]
(looks up in surprise)
Huh? What? Oh.
(goes back to business)
Look, kid, I have an OBSCENE amount of paperwork to process! Grownup business, okay!
If you're lost, go look for an orphanage or something, I don't have time for this.

[Becky]
(aheming)
S... sir?

[McMayor]
Now, get lost! Go play with some... dolls or something!

[Becky]
Sir!

[McMayor]
What, Becky? Can't you see I'm getting rid of this kid that's standing ominously in the doorway?

[&]
What? Would we have it stand in the corner during our meeting with **The Hero of Spirit**? That has to go perfect, Becky, perfect!

[Becky]
But, sir, this child IS the Hero of Spirit!

[McMayor]
Are... are you sure about that?

[Becky]
Yes.

The mayor pauses for another moment.

[McMayor]
Greetings, hero! Welcome to my humble office! Feel free to stand in the doorway as much as you'd like!

(APD) Claire takes a few steps forward and looks at his office.

// There's all kinds of fun flavour text regarding the many, many objects cluttering the room.

[McMayor]
Alright. The topic of our meeting is—
the state of the world as you might've seen it.

[Claire]
Oh.
(wide-eyed, expecting answers)
Yeah?

[McMayor]
We're interested in knowing when do you plan to resume your activities as **The Hero Of Spirit**.

[Claire]
(narrow-eyed, confused)
As what?

[McMayor]
As **The Hero Of Spirit**.

[Claire]
(narrow-eyed, confused)
Again—  what?

[McMayor]
You're playing hard to get, huh, kid...

[Claire]
I literally have no idea what you're talking about, sir...

#BGM (silence)

[McMayor]
Well, in this case...

McMayor steps out of his chair and goes around the table.
Claire steps back. The man puts his hand on the table, his back turned to Claire.

[&]
You leave me no other option...

The screen starts to flash black, threatening a battle. The HP meter shows up... but then suddenly, the HUD drops and the music blasts on again as he drops to his knees in a begging position.

#BGM Politics (Chorus)

[McMayor]
Please help us, hero! We're completely lost without you!

[Claire]
I... I...

[McMayor]
Is it money that you want? I can pay you a fee for your service! Here's a sack of gold.

[Claire]
I...

%PROMPT "Okay, I'll do it.", "More."

[&]
(thinks for a moment)
More.

The mayor pulls another sack of gold. This isn't animated, the sacks of gold just appear piling up in front of Claire with jump-cuts.

%PROMPT "Okay, I'll do it.", "More."

[&]
(with a straight face)
More.

The mayor pulls two more sacks of gold.

%PROMPT "Okay, I'll do it.", "More."

[&]
(smiling childishly, her arms out)
More!!!

The mayor pulls out a single other sack of gold.

[McMayor]
Please, hero! This is all I have!

[Claire]
(smiling)
Okay yeah I'll do it.

[McMayor]
(recomposing himself)
Excellent.

[Becky]
(with complete sincerity)
Masterful play, sir.

[Claire]
Wait, what did I just agree to...?

[Becky]
Well, we want to help you save your world.
Your family, your friends, they're in danger, aren't they?

[Claire]
(down)
...

[Becky]
When it happened, we felt it from here.
The shockwave shook the earth.
I can't imagine what you must've gone through being so close to the epicentre.
No wonder you're so disoriented.

The mayor returns to his seat and rearranges his tie.

(APD) Claire pockets the 5 sacks of gold. Narration reads "You pocket the gold. Got 5 gold."

// Also, every time someone says "The Ancient Scroll" here they say it with glimmering turquoise waving text and a mysterious sound cue.

[Claire]
(confused but smiling)
Alright, what do you want me to do?

[McMayor]
Well, close that disgusting tear, of course!

[Claire]
I— I...

[Becky]
(mumbling)
Oh yeah it does look quite unsightly, doesn't it...

.[[The Elder]], [[Rosetta]] and [[Rim]] enter the room. They look at Claire, very surprised. The Elder walks up to her, gives one look, then walks on.

[The Elder]
The Hero has been affected by powerful sorcery...
Her identity has been taken away...

The Elder turns to Becky.

[&]
Becky, we have something to discuss.

Becky turns to the mayor.

[Becky]
Oh... uh... um...
Sir, if the hero needs a refresher, perhaps we can provide it with **The Ancient Scroll**, no?

The Elder looks out of the window, while Rim and Rosetta talk about something.

[McMayor]
Excellent idea, Becky. Hand me the scroll and we will remind the hero of her duty.

[Becky]
Well...

[McMayor]
What?
You don't have it?

[Becky]
Well, you see....

[McMayor]
Becky— you're fired!

[Becky]
H— huh?

[McMayor]
Have you lost the most important document in our land?

[Claire]
(mumbling)
no don't fire her

[Becky]
I didn't lose it! I simply handed it to _the Professor_ for preservation!

[McMayor]
The Professor Wacko?

Becky pulls Claire aside.

[Becky]
(exhasperated)
Uhhh... Human, can you do me a huge favour and go to Professor Whynott's house, and retrieve **The Ancient Scroll** for me, would you, kid?
His house is just at beginning of town, ya can't miss it.

[Claire]
Okay. It's an ancient scroll I'm looking for.

[Becky]
**The Ancient Scroll**

[Claire]
Okay, sure, I'll get it.

// If you interact with the Mayor again:

[Claire]
Your name is "Manuel M. McMayor"???

[McMayor]
Sure thing. Why?

[Claire]
So you're a mayor... And your name is "McMayor"?

[McMayor]
(annoyed)
What's the confusion about?
I am from the prosperous McMayor family, we are proud to carry this name across generations! My grandfather was a McMayor, my father was a McMayor, and now so am I!

[Claire]
Oh... so you come from a family of mayors...

[McMayor]
Huh? What gave you THAT idea?!
The McMayors are internationally renowned dentists.
The PIONEERS in door-assisted deciduous removal.

[Claire]
Your grandpa and your dad, they weren't mayors?

[McMayor]
Nope.

(APD) Claire steps out of the office, finding that the kids were eavesdropping through the door.

#BGM Hearthaven

[Evelyn]
Heyyyy foreigner! Can you play now?

[Claire]
Sorry... I have to find some professor about a scroll.

[Evelyn]
Oh, the weird scientist guy? He's funny.
His house is just SOUTH of here.

%IF Claire walks DOWN in the frame

[Enzo]
What? Where are you going?

[Claire]
You said his house is south of here?

[Evelyn]
Yeah, south! In...
(pointing to the top right of frame)
That direction.

[Claire]
I don't have a compass on me!

[Evelyn]
Yeah but why did you start walking on a random direction.

[Enzo]
You could've asked.

Claire slow blinks.

%FINALLY

(APD) Claire can walk away. When she gets a few hundred feet away, Erica comes by running.

[Erica]
(worried)
Uh, wait!!!
(smiling)
Actually, we'll help you get there.

[Claire]
(confused, but glad)
Oh, sure, okay.

(APD) Claire and the kids walk to the professor's house. Talking to the residents now, they are much more comfortable with her presence.

They'll say things like:

"It's been a while since we've had a human over. A long while. Welcome!"

"Did you fall through a tear, my dear? Are you hurt? If you want some tea, I'll be making some later."

"Woah... you look REALLY lost. Don't worry, you're safe here now, alright?"

"Our homes have been destroyed, too, but we've made this place our own. We hope it can be your home, too."

(APD) Claire arrives at the Professor's door. She knocks on the door softly. No response.

[Enzo]
(to Erica)
You think he's home?

[Evelyn]
He rarely leaves his house...

[Enzo]
What does he even do?

[Erica]
He used to build deadly robots for the royal guard...

Claire turns around.

[Claire]
(worried)
Deadly robots???

[Erica]
(sighing dreamingly)
Deadly robots...

Claire turns back to the door and knocks on it again, more firmly. On the third knock, a loud explosion blasts the Professor and the door out of the doorway, Claire barely dodges.

Smoke starts to pour out of the windows.

.[[Professor Whynott]], covered in ash, gets up coughing.

[Claire]
Are... You Professor Whynott?

[Whynott]
The one and onely (sic), kiddo!

[Claire]
I'm here to get the... uh... the ancient scroll.

[Whynott]
The what?

[Claire]
The anc-

[Whynott]
Oh, the **The Ancient Scroll!**! Sorry, didn't get your accent there.
Why, I just got a telegram about it! It's in my house!
(he speaks with a mad doctor neurotic tone)
Unfortunately, my dear, you find me now to be in a bit of a pickle, you see...
My newest humanoid automaton has gone: Haywire!

[Claire]
Oh...

[Whynott]
Yeah, it's a real hicklerydoo (sic) indeed.
(he snaps into a pose with his index finger up, a metaphorical lightbulb turning on in his head)
A plan!

[Claire]
Oh.

[Whynott]
If you wouldn't mind assisting me for a moment, darling, between you and me I am CERTAIN we could execute an AMBUSH on my creation.

[Evelyn]
(awestruck)
Coming over here never disappoints...

[Whynott]
If you dash through the door and grab its attention and distract it for THREE TURNS
(he pulls up the number three with his hand)
I can pull off its plug from the wall, rendering it harmless!
What do you think?

[Claire]
I... um... uhh...

Claire takes a step back.

[Erica]
It's... just a battle...
You've been in lots of those haven't you?

[Evelyn]
Awww the hero is modest...

%PROMPT "Let's go", "Let's not"

//The prompt above is interrupted.

Claire barely has any time to think before she's pulled along by the excited Professor.

[Whynott]
We have no time to waste! Come on!

Whynott rushes Claire into the house.

== Steamy Battle ==
Where: Hearthaven/Atelier
Summary: At Prof. Whynott's Atelier, one of his projects has gone haywire! Claire helps neutralise the rather unperilous threat and retrieves the stories.

#TRANS Fade out and in

(APD) Claire enters the room, seeing a weird flaming single-wheeled automaton running back and forth. The house is completely thrashed, as if a struggle (and an explosion) has just taken place. The robot sees Claire and runs into her.

#BGM Battle Against A Prototype

The automaton attacks Claire with very easy fire bullet attacks, and a very easy cogwheel one.

Narration for the three turns read:

"Baker Owen comes in steaming!"

"Fire bullets light up the room."

"The children cheer you on from the door!"

After the third turn, Professor Whynott tries, but fails(!) to pull the plug.

"Professor Whynott trips on the electricity cord and falls!"

"Professor Whynott tries to get up but trips on the same cord again!"

"Professor Whynott gets too cozy on the floor and accidentally takes a nap!"

So you must either FIGHT or Spare the enemy to defeat it. If it takes too long,
Erica will pull the cord and you get a draw.

// Dying here brings you back to just outside the professor's atelier, even though the game hasn't been saved. It's very difficult to die, though.

%IF you win by Sparing, people congratulate you for it!
%IF you win by FIGHTING, Prof. Whynott displays sadness, but, ultimately concedes "Ahh, who cares. It's just a machine, anyways."

The automaton's eyes lose their light.

[Whynott]
There we have it— rogue explosive automaton is no more!

[Claire]
Well, if anything that did succeed at being a dangerous, deadly robot...

[Whynott]
Huh! Why, that would've served me well back in my Royal Scientist days, wouldn't it?
(thinking nostalgically)
I can't remember the last time I had the opportunity to design a device built for the sole purpose of tearing apart human flesh. Not since...

[&]
Oh. But you are not here to listen to an old man's nostalgic rambling.

[&]
Professor Wyatt Whynott, at your disposal.

[Claire]
I'm here to retrieve the—

[Whynott]
**The Ancient Scroll!** That's right! I just got a telegram about it.

[Claire]
You said that!

[Whynott]
That's right!
(turning around)
Hmm... it must be somewhere... around here...

[Whynott]
How peculiar. How odd indeed.
I specifically recall being handed the scroll for an important motive...

[Claire]
Preservation... Maybe you put it in a box!

[Whynott]
A box! Genius!

[Claire]
I'll help you look for it.

(APD) Claire looks around, interacting with things. There's an oven, a sink, a pile of garbage, another pile of garbage. Eventually she may talk to the professor again.

[Whynott]
Me? I wouldn't keep such an important document on my pocket...

[Claire]
I was just gonna ask if—

[Whynott]
Wait... How better could I take constant care of it than to carry it on my person at all times!
Marvelous idea, Mi—
(pause)
Hear, I don't believe I caught your name, my dear?

[Claire]
"Claire."

[Whynott]
Well, Claire, now I remember it all!
I was asked to transfer our history from that old piece of parchment, **The Ancient Scroll** into a more space-efficient storage method.
(he pulls something out of his hat)
Take good care of this.

Narration reads "Got **The Ancient 32GB Memory Card**."

[Claire]
Thanks!

(APD) You can talk to him again.

[Claire]
Will you need any help cleaning up?

[Whynott]
Cleaning up? Oh— what a misunderstanding.
My office just looks like that.
An inventor's atelier needs a healthy coating of ash and debris at all times.

[Claire]
(nodding)
To get the brain juices flowing.

[Whynott]
"The brain juices"? Ha ha! What a precious analogy! You must be the creative type!

[Claire]
(smiling)
Ha ha.
(straight-faced)
No, not really.

(APD) You can leave.

== The Story ==
Where: Hearthaven
Summary: Claire brings the stories back to the mayor hall. Claire participates in the town's evening communal storytelling event and learns about her own role as The Hero of Spirit! This is a warm little village, she could stay here forever. Not really, though, and [[Evangeline|the Elder]] urges her to leave to [[The Mirror]] to recover from the incident.

[Erica]
(worried)
Hey, uh... can we talk about something...

[Claire]
What is it?

[Evelyn]
Yeah, what is it Erica?

[Erica]
Um... nevermind... it's nothing.

[Claire]
Are... you sure?

[Erica]
Oh, wow. I can feel an aura of importance around that item.
You should go to the Mayor's office immediately before you lose it.

[Claire]
Oh!

[Erica]
Or not, I won't judge, I'm not your mum.

(APD) You can walk back to the mayor's office. You can talk to people again but you can't go inside any other buildings.

#BGM (silence)

When you arrive in the office, Claire stops at the door, seeing the adults seem to be talking about something serious around the office.

[Rim]
...we've never seen one this big...

[Rosetta]
...there's only one thing this could be...

[McMayor]
...we don't know yet what this is...

[Rosetta]
...Manuel, it's a tear like one of ours...
...And we didn't open it so it could've only been the...

Becky catches eye of Claire and announces her presence loudly.

[Becky]
Oh, seems like the human has returned!

[McMayor]
(surprised)
Oh, ha ha— Hello there, hero! Did you retrieve the item? Put it on the table.

// You'll have to, once again, use the item on the table from the inventory.

Claire will slam the memory card on the table with a loud thud, startling everybody (except The Elder).

[Claire]
It's DELIVERED!!!!!!

[McMayor]
I see it!
Alright, alright! I see you're inching back to your classic, excited self, aren't you, hero?

[Claire]
What?

[McMayor]
I've heard a lot about you. Lively girl. 
No memory hm... Good thing the Professor invented these handy devices. They do the remembering FOR you, ha!
(tosses the card to the assistant)
Becky, analysis.

Becky pulls out a device to plug in the memory card and starts scrolling through files for a while.

[Rosetta]
I'll get a room ready for our guest.

[Rim]
I'll gather some supplies.

Rosetta and Rim leave the room.

[McMayor]
What's taking so goddamn long?

[Becky]
(fixing her glasses)
There are a bajillion files here, sir!

Becky starts scrolling through the many, many legends.

[Becky]
Kid lost in whitespace... no...
Alien turns animals rabid... no...
Girl climbs up a big mountain... no...
Little boy wakes up sleeping fish... no...
When the world is subsumed by shadow... hell no...
Blond lad saves the prin— didn't I see this kid before...

[Claire]
Excuse me, what's all that stuff anyways?

[Becky]
Oh, as you know, there are these (huff)
tears in reality... leading from your side to ours...

[Claire]
Tears... is that what that was...

[Becky]
You've fallen through one, huh?

[Claire]
Yeah... no...
Uh... maybe?

[Becky]
Well, every so often a human child will be exploring unsupervised and end up here...

[Mayor]
...and we have to babysit them.

[Becky]
Don't listen to him— it is an *honour* to serve these young humans for as long as they stay.
Sometimes when the world fails to provide a... safe space for children to explore themselves,
we offer them a little bit of escapism, so they can rest and adventure and grow into themselves...

[Mayor]
Meanwhile I have to issue all the paperwork for the passports, the visa, ID, and arrange a travel plan to get them home. Speaking of which — here's your passport.

(APD) You can pick it up. "'Dream Passport' was added to your SPECIAL items."

[Claire]
So... I'm to understand I'm one of these kids...

[Becky]
Oh, no, not at all. You're something different.
(she looks up at Claire smiling)
Something very different.

[Claire]
Ahhhh... what does any of that meeeeean...

[Becky]
(still looking at Claire)
You'll see.
(looks down at the computer)
Aha—!
When the angel who's seen the surface blah blah the underground— oh wait no, it's not this one either.

[Becky]
Nana, you think we can tell this one during Storytime for the human?

[Claire]
During what now?

[Becky]
Every night we all gather together to hear a story around the village hearth.
It's just a silly thing we do.

[Claire]
I... see...

[Becky]
Yes! I found it!

Becky runs out of the door with the file.

[Claire]
Oh, neat-o!

%IF you talk to the mayor again

[McMayor]
What are you waiting for, a kiss on the forehead?
Get outta here!

Getting outside, everybody is gathered in the village centre. The yarn golems hold ceremonial torches (lit matches) and [[Evangeline]], The Elder, holds her needle staff in the middle, awaiting Claire's arrival.

// (APD) You can walk around and inspect the buildings and stuff. There's, of course, the passage to the old city ruins. I think approaching it will make the music stop, and only a quiet wind can be heard. Ominous.

[Erica]
Hey, hey! I saved you a good spot!

Claire steps through the mass and sits in the front, besides Erica.

[McMayor]
Good evening, folks. We find ourselves once again together, all well, to tell stories to one another.
The tale we've chosen to tell today is a very special one, it's one that each and every one of you already knows.
As is tradition, your madam, The Elder, will now narrate it for us.

[The Elder]
Thank you, lad.
Please, folks of Hearthaven, old and new, residents...
and foreigners...
Open your hearts to this old tale.

Manuel opens the lid of the hearth, revealing it to be the lens of a projector.

#CAM Pans into the sky, framing the projection, a rectangular frame, which looks like a 70's home-made video recording.

// The small rectangular frame is reminiscent of Survival Kids or UNDERTALE.

#BGM The Eternal Tale

The camera (within the projection) pans slowly from below, where it frames stars and darkness.

[The Elder]
Since a time long forgotten,
Drifting in the void,
Nestled in a sunbeam,

When she says Earth, the camera lands on Earth as seen from space, with a flare from the sun shining on top of its image, mimicking the imagery within the poem. A mix of Earthrise and The Pale Blue Dot.

[&]
EARTH,
your home,
lies within our care.

Cave people dancing around a bonfire.

[&]
And from the EARTH you grow,
HOPE guides your hearts

Close up of a wall where kids are playing with the shadows. The wall has some paintings on it: negative handprints, stick figures, shapes.

[&]
And every DREAM you make
A new adventure starts.

The slide shows  a younger child from close holding a small flower like a little golden flame about to be snuffed by the wind. The child looks scared and despondent. Their body is covered in thorns and wounds.

[&]
But...
Sometimes there'll be...
A SOUL that's different...
Its heart's been bruised...
Its body beaten.

The child is shown running away into the woods, the sunrise in the background.

[&]
We hear their story...

The child walks over a creek towards what seems to be a cave.

[&]
We hear their pain...

The kid is inside the cave, their hand touching the cave wall, as a blue light shines from deep within.

[&]
We make a portal...

Intimate closeup shot of their eyes awestruck by whatever they are seeing.

[&]
We call their name...

Framing the cave entrance beginning to close, leaving no trace.

[&]
If they come out
They're not the same

#TRANS The entire screen goes white, then slowly black.

[The Elder]
This, Hero, is our purpose.
Guiding these lost SOULs...
This is the role *you* have taken on, too.
But today, something else looms in the horizon...

#TRANS Fade

A scene from the real world plays, in 4:3, showing the streets of New Horizon bathed in apocalyptic red light. It's raining.

// This is a scene from the future, an event which happens off-screen between the end of Episode 03 and the start of Episode 04. This makes sense if you've read the Episode 04 script.

#CAM Slowly panning upwards, to frame the empty sky.

Lightning flashes, lighting the vast night sky.

[&]
Boiling with hatred...

Suddenly, with the mention of it, the silhouette of The Angel — its many concentric rings — is illuminated in the next two lightning flashes.

[&]
A *terror from another world*...
threatens all worlds
with *anihilation*.

#TRANS Smash to black with a lightning sound.

[&]
We thought it but a legend...
But, today...

#TRANS Fade in

Another image from the real world, this time it's the school tear.

[&]
A sinistrous force has awakened in your side.
And the threads of fate begin to unravel...

#TRANS Slow fade out and then fade in.

Everybody is silent, solemnly.

Claire stands up.

[The Elder]
Hero, you must leave this instant and pursue your destiny.

Rosetta gets alarmed.

[Rosetta]
Elder, please allow her to rest if just for a short while.
While we pack her some items for her travels.

[The Elder]
Hm...
Very well.

[Rosetta]
I'll get everything ready.

Rosetta walks to the right.

[Claire]
I'm... This is...

Rosetta stops to reassure Claire,

[Rosetta]
(trying to lighten Claire up)
But, Claire, you're safe here with us for as long as you stay, okay?

then continues leaving.

The crowd begins to disperse.

[Evelyn]
Nana... Can the human not stay with us? We wanted to play—

[The Elder]
It is decided. She must leave today, after a brief respite.

The kids slowly go their ways.

== A Dream Come True ==
Summary: Erica, one of the children townsfolk bonds with Claire on the roof. Claire is urged to leave the town in a small quest towards the Mirror. She's unsure of what lies up ahead.

// She's like, big to contrast with the mayor's small size. She's, like, an old actress type, with lots of quirky pink clothing, a hat, a glimmering dress and some good ol' (American) southern hospitality.

[Rosetta]
Welcome, darling! Oh, do get right in, mind the gap, but come, come!

Claire walks a bit more around the inside.

[&]
It's so good to receive you here, really!
It's been so long since a human has found themselves here! So long...

[Claire]
More like _lost_ myself here...

[Rosetta]
Ah ha ha ha ha! "lost mys-" ha ha ha!
Ohhh darling, Nana told me that your mind is all scrambled, isn't it right, hun?
Oh, don't worry — it happens!
See, I'll be preparing your room: once you get a good night's sleep, your memories will come flowing back to you in no time! Unless they don't, in which case, that's unfortunate.

[Claire]
(with "Oh, wait, really?" eyes)
I see. Thanks, ma'am.

[Rosetta]
Ma'am? Who are you calling ma'am?

[Claire]
I—

[Rosetta]
Who am I kidding, I've been aging—
(widening her eyebrows)
Like fine wine, though! Ah ha ha!
(smiling)
Will you hand me your passport for a moment, dear...

Claire hands her the passport. She inputs some information into a toy computer, then gives her the passport back.

[Rosetta]
Yes... Yes... Thank you, here ya go.
Alright, "Claire," your room is right there waitin' fer you.
Get a good night's sleep to be on your way home as soon as possible.

[Claire]
...

[Rosetta]
(winking)
You're the quiet, "go along with it" type, but I'm sure you've been lookin' for some answers to some questions haven't you?

[Claire]
(smiling)
Oh... um...

[Rosetta]
Well you ain't getting any of them now! The faster you snooze, the faster you wake up!

[Claire]
You know what, some rest would actually probably do me good right now.

[Rosetta]
Yes it will, hun.

Claire enters her room. It's neat. Unlike the previous room, it's lit in blue instead of warm orange. Her expression becomes serious (the smile vanishes from her face).

Claire walks to the bed and lays down on it for a moment. She puts her hands over her face for a moment and brushes her eyes. The pace of the scene slows down to the minimum, now that she has some time for herself.

[Claire]
...

A brief pause.

[Claire]
Good night, me!

#TRANS Fade to black.
#SAVE Game is saved here.
#TRANS Slow fade in.

Claire wakes up, not felling that well rested.

As she tries to get up, she finds a dead mouse placed upon her, which she throws out of herself immediately. (That's a gift from Pierre)

[Claire]
Ghmghmm... Morning...
(wiping her eyes)
Daaad!

Claire wakes up and walks towards the door, and peeks through it. Rosetta is nowhere to be seen.

[Claire]
Dad... I got cramps...
(she looks around the strange place)
Dad?

A pause of realization.

[Claire]
Oh...

Erica pops up by the window, upside down.

[Erica]
Hey! I was uhhh watching you sleep...

[Claire]
(nodding sarcastically)
A normal thing to do.

[Erica]
Oh, great! I thought I was being weird for a moment.
Come to the roof.

Erica slides up out of view. Claire follows her to the roof and, seeing the city, sits besides her. Erica points up to the sky, where glow-in-the-dark star stickers glow. The two look up for a moment.

[Erica]
How... um...

Erica looks at some writing on her hand.

[Erica]
"Hello. How Has Your Day Been?"

Erica looks at Claire.

[Claire]
Those stars...

[Erica]
Hm? What about them?

[Claire]
They look like...

[Erica]
Oh, yeah, they're stickers. The glow-in-the-dark kind.

Claire laughs.

[Claire]
I think I understand...

A brief pause.

[&]
This... this is a dream...
Isn't it...

[Erica]
(surprised)
A dream?
Uh... wow...
(smiling)
I... I feel the same.

[Claire]
I must've fallen asleep in the bathroom...
Or... in the forest? I don't know...
(scoffs)
For a moment I entertained the idea that I walked into another world from a portal in a treehouse.

[Erica]
(smiling, awestruck)
Woah, you came here through a portal?
I mean... of course...

[Claire]
Huh? Yeah, a tunnel...

[Erica]
Wooooah...
Is...
Is the physical realm... really real?

[Claire]
What?

[Erica]
Sorry, it's a weird question... but...
I've never met someone from another realm before...
Whenever I've heard of Earth... it's so strange...
(she starts brushing her hair with her hands and looking away from Claire)
Nana told me you have something called the "Laws of Physics" that... make your body behave in just one way...

[&]
And since our Laws of Stories don't apply there... sometimes things just... happen? With no cause or reason why? That sounds... so... alien to me.

[Claire]
...

[Erica]
I wish I could visit your side, but...
The threshold, we can't... you know...
Nana's training me to be a seamstress like her...
So maybe one day I'll get to...

Erica trails off.
A long pause.

[Erica]
I guess the stars in your world don't look anything like this since you called it out so quickly.
Since we're dreaming right now, well...
My dream is that I'll get to see the stars one day.
Maybe then I'll understand.

[Claire]
You wouldn't see nothing with all the light pollution.

[Erica]
Huh... well, I'd be glad to meet the locals at least. I'd make all sorts of friends.

Claire reminisces for a moment.

[Claire]
Eh... I'm not sure about that.
I had trouble fitting in and I just came from *Japan*.
Imagine you, from a whole different world.

[Erica]
Well, t- they'd be chill after they see I'm nice.

[Claire]
Ha. If you're nice that's when they get you harder.
I wish I'd grown up in a place like this.
Small village, tight-knit community...
Your people are so nice...
Y'know, your world seems cool.
Dream world.
Beats... uhh... rubbles and monsters, I think...

[Erica]
(perplexed)
Th... thank you.

A brief pause.

[Erica]
I guess it _is_ cool.
(smiling)
I always... dreamed... of having a friend my age...
Hey, Evelyn and Enzo are nice, but...
(flustered)
I'm... really glad you came.

She smiles at Claire. Claire is still looking into the distance and doesn't reply.

[Erica]
Maybe I can talk to Nana about you staying...

[Claire]
I don't think that'll happen.

[Erica]
I see.
(awkward)
Well, uh... um...
Gotta go!

Erica yeets herself off the roof, leaving the frame (we never hear her land). Claire looks to the sky one last time, then crawls back through the window and sits on the bed for a moment, before getting up.

(APD) You can go back in the bedroom.

As you leave the room, Rosetta is finishing packing your stuff.

[Rosetta]
Oh, dear, did you manage to rest at all?

[Claire]
Mmm...

[Rosetta]
Here, have these for your travels.
I hope we meet again under not so hurrying circumstances!

[Claire]
Thank you...

When you leave the inn, you can talk to NPCs outside. Some people will say stuff like:

"Huh? Already leaving? Okay!"

"Even though your stay was short, you brought joy into our monotonous lives for at least a few moments."

"Good luck out there! Don't die and stuff!"

When you get to the catacomb doors, Evangeline will have a small conference with you.

A brief pause.

[The Elder]
Young heroine. You seek the way back home, do you not?

[Claire]
Yes.

[The Elder]
There is only one way for you to return safely.
In the bleak catacombs... the ruins of the old city...
Find **The Mirror**, and exit through it.

A brief pause.

[The Elder]
It is not poor hospitality; my hand is forced to urge you to seek your destiny this night.
The Hero of Spirit is the light in the path of many, the guide of lost souls.
But tonight, both you and your world are wounded in insidious ways, and you find yourself in the role of the student once again. And there is no guide to help you.
Now. You must be your own light.

She hands Claire a lit match.

[&]
Claire. For everyone's sake. You must reach **The Mirror** and exit to your world.

// Double entendre here, by "your world" Claire understands "Earth," but Nana means Claire's otherworld. Somni always refer to the physical realm as a "realm," never a "world."

[Claire]
The Mirror. Yep. Got it.

Evangeline looks at her for a moment.

[Evelyn]
(sad)
Bye, human...

[Enzo]
Huh... where's Erica?

[Evelyn]
GASP! How rude of her, she didn't even care to say goodbye!

[Rosetta]
Take care out there, will ya?

She hands you some star cookies.

[McMayor]
You will need some money in your journey.
Alright, take this, and don't say I never gave you anything.
Don't spend it all in one place!

Narration reads "Got 1 gold."

[Claire]
Thanks for the stay. You were all very kind.

Finally, Claire leaves the city.

// You can come back in, everyone will be gone.
// There are some secrets to be hidden here later.

== The Journey Starts ==
Where: Nadir Forest
Summary: Claire and Prof. Whynott set out on their expedition. This place is eerie, but she won't have to go through all of it alone.

Claire walks into the twisted dark forest of hollow trees that encircles Hearthaven. As she walks, the trees creep dark and tall above her. The ground is filled with snowy soot. It's really dark, with a lof of pure black. The only light that illuminates anything are some long yellow light poles.

After walking for a short while, she runs into Pierre chilling inside an empty tram station. You can interact with him.

The Mystery Kid and Pierre are hanging out.

(APD) Claire talks to the two of them.

[The Mystery Kid]
Hey there, partner! Taking a late evening stroll, are you?

[Claire]
What are you doing here?

[The Mystery Kid]
Woah! Okay! Nice to see you too, Mrs. Hanako.

[Claire]
Oh... you're... from this world too, aren't you?

[The Mystery Kid]
What? Just because I'm weird and mysterious and magic?
Yeah.

[Pierre]
Hey, Claire... You look pretty worried...

[Claire]
Worried? Me?

[The Mystery Kid]
Well, just to say it's not a weakness to admit you don't got it all together, you know? It would be weird if you WEREN'T scared at least sometimes.
Speaking of which, let me share some advice.

[&]
Whenever you feel anxious... right before doing something critical for example...
What you should do is... calm down... breathe... and touch this cat.

[Claire]
Huh?

[The Mystery Kid]
Touch. The cat. Go on, let's rehearse it now.

[Pierre]
Oh yes! Touch me like only you know how~

[Claire]
I'm—
I'm not touching THIS cat...

[The Mystery Kid]
Pierre: be normal.
Claire: Touch the cat!
Touch it! Touch the cat!
Touch! The! Cat!

[Claire]
Aaaaaaaaaaaah alright!!

Claire pets Pierre.

#SAVE Save menu appears.

// This is the first instance of the save menu appearing proper. It always appears with a nice purr sound effect. The two options are "Record" and "Not now". Pressing "Record" does a nice tape recorder sound effect. After saving, the options are "Continue" or "Leave". Pressing continue does a nice chiptune sound effect. There's a callback to this in Episode 5 believe me or not.

[Claire]
Awwww... You just wanted a little love didn't you.

[Pierre]
You got me!

[The Mystery Kid]
I knew you were a cat person!
Well, don't you feel much better now?

[Claire]
Huh?
Yeah I guess so... a little...

// Talking to the Mystery Kid again

[Claire]
So uh... what train are you getting?

[The Mystery Kid]
No I just like to hang out in the forest at night.
What train are you getting?

[Claire]
I dunno.

[The Mystery Kid]
Yeah.

You may buy something at the vending machine with your gold.

After being there for a little while, a tram will arrive and wait for her to enter. When she does enter, she sits for a moment. All the other seats are empty. Then, the conductor will summon her to the cabin. (APD) She'll get up and head to the front. 

There you'll seeprofessor Whynott is manning the tram.

[Whynott]
Welcome aboard, Claire, my dear!

[Claire]
Professor! It's great to see you!
Are you the conductor?

[Whynott]
Observant as always, I see! Why yes, I am the conductor, indeed!

[Claire]
(sarcastic "very funny" expression)
I just thought you were an inventor.

[Whynott]
Well, I used to be! Back in the good old days...
Now, well, I can't support my "hobby" on a "former Royal Scientist" salary!

[Claire]
How much does a bus driver make?

[Whynott]
Darling, this is a tram! It's like a bus — on rail!
If you believe me, your world used to have them all around.

[Claire]
I see...
How much does a tram driver make?

The tram suddenly screeches to a halt.

[Whynott]
Scandalous.

[Claire]
What happened?

[Whynott]
There seems to be an obstacle in the rail up ahead.
(his index finger jumps into the air)
Idea! There is a maintenance station up ahead — it should have the necessary controls to unobstruct the way... Claire, would you kindly—

[Claire]
Yes, sir!

(APD) Claire steps off the tram and enters the station.

#BGM Liminal

(APD) Claire enters the decrepit station, accidentally stepping on a teddy bear laying on the ground. She grabs a lever fixed into the panel and, with effort (and a minigame), activates it.

#CAM Shows rail outside.

The ground below the rail activates like a spring launch mechanism that yeets the logs on top of the rail forward. Then it settles.

#CAM Shows Claire again.

Claire rolls her shoulders.

[Claire]
That should do it.

(APD) She heads back out, stepping on the plush again.

Before she can leave the room, a voice calls her out of nowhere.

#BGM (silence)

[Theodor]
Hey!

Claire looks around.

[Theodor]
Yes! You!

#BGM Eerie

The toy bear starts floating in the air, startling Claire.

[&]
What's the big idea, huh kid?

[Claire]
What???

[Theodor]
The FIRST time you stepped on me — fine, maybe she didn't see me — I thought. I'm laying on the ground, the room is dark...
And then!!! You stepped on me AGAIN???

[Claire]
Oh...

[Theodor]
"Oh..." I know your kind! You think you can step all over people and they don't do anything, huh!!! You... my old boss... my ex-wife— YOU'RE ALL THE SAME!!!

[Claire]
I'm sorry I stepped on you, sir, I didn't mean to—

[Theodor]
WELL HEAR THIS!!! I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT FEELS!!! NOBODY'S STEPPING ON ME EVER AGAIN!!!

During the fight, Theodor will continuously try to step on you doing pathetic damage (it is so soft).

Narration reads "This bear don't care!", "Smells like dust.", "The air is filled with rage and cotton.", "Teddy's legs are so soft they deal 1 damage." on a loop.

[Claire]
Gah! Don't hit me!

[Teddy]
Wahahaha! Feel my furaay!!!

// You can defeat Teddy by giving him money or talking to him and letting him vent about uhh... his boss that "fired him" by telling him he "works too much and deserves a nice vacation" and his wife that scheduled a nice night out but didn't show up... hours before the great evacuation... You can also defeat him by punching him or setting him on fire.

(APD) Claire comes back from the station to the tram cabin.

[Whynott]
Great job, kiddo!

[Claire]
What can I say, I'm a mind boggling, lever toggling queen.

[Whynott]
Whatt? (sic)

[Claire]
Let's keep going.

The tram continues forward.

#TRANS Corny 80's clock wipe transition.

== A Hesitation ==
Summary: Nevermind. The train gets to Aurora and while the sights are incredible, [[The Bleakness]] makes itself felt with the presence of corrupted Somni. Bleaked wasps attack the tram. Claire hesitates to jump, which costs the Professor's chance at an escape.

The tram continues to Aurora, the vegetation getting promptly duller as the sky appears. It's sunrise. The golden sun adds some colour to the grey sky. You can see, in the distance, the clouds taking over the sky as the tram makes progress into the catacombs, the rain hitting the top of the tram weirdly soothing. Nearing a cliff, the tram converts into a suspended tram and gently drifts in-between the stems of giant flowers.

[Claire]
Woah...

[Whynott]
(smiling)

[Claire]
Wait, are all these flowers big or did we become tiny?
Oh, am I'm rambling too much? Hehehe...

The Professor takes a deep breath.

[Whynott]
Ah, not at all.

[Claire]
Huge droplets. So round.

[Whynott]
How I missed the conversations one has with passengers. Driving these trams around, a surefire way to enrich the SOUL...

[Claire]
If... no one comes here... Then why do you drive the tram?

[Whynott]
Well, somebody has to! If nobody else is will, it's up to ye old Professor!

[Claire]
(smiling)
No, but, like, how do you even collect fares—

Suddenly, something falls into the tram ceiling with a jarring thud.

[Whynott]
Mind checking what that was?

[Claire]
On it.

Claire opens the window to look outside the tram, and a Wadwasp pours in!

[Claire]
I... uh... got this! I think!

#VS a single Wadwasp. You can set it on fire... or soothe it by talking to it.
#BGM Battle Incoming!

[Claire]
Oh yeah... that's...

A bunch of bleaked bees pour into the train and inch toward Claire.

[&]
What's the collective noun for bee?

[Whynott]
"Swarm" — are you alright back there?

Claire freezes while looking at the bees approaching. Seeing Claire take too long, Prof. Whynott concocts a plan.

[Whynott]
You're... Uh... Athletic, right? You're pretty young, got some nice legs for jumping?

[Claire]
What kinda question is that?
Well, I do gymnastics...

[Whynott]
That's what kind of question that it is!

The professor jumps from the conductor's seat and pushes the bees away with his hat, and backs down into the cabin, letting Claire enter first. Then he closes the cabin door, using his body to keep it shut.

[Whynott]
Claire, darling, open the door, will you?

The door opens, and air rushes by, the tram starts to shake pretty intensely. Both of them have to shout.

[&]
Now, hear me — ugh — you're gonna have to jump!
Find something that will break your fall and go for it!

[Claire]
J... jump???
We're a hundred feet in the air!!!

[Whynott]
No we are not!
You'll be fine!

[Claire]
W- what about you? You have a plan?

[Whynott]
The plan — ugh — is to get you to safety.

[Claire]
You can't fight all of these things by yourself...
Maybe if we try together...

[Whynott]
I'm jump after you.

The player will be prompted to choose "Jump"... But Claire will not do it.

[Whynott]
(preoccupied)
Claire, please, jump! NOW!!

[Claire]
I... can't! It's too high! I can't jump!

[Whynott]
You can't stay there frozen either!

[Claire]
My legs... they won't...

The bees break through the door and come swarming in.

[Whynott]
NOW!!! Get to Aurora!! find **The Mirror** and GET OUT!! NOW, JUMP!!

Claire closes her eyes and lets herself go.

#TRANS Cut to black.

And in black we stay for a moment.

== DREAM my own dream ==
Where: Aurora/Outskirts
Summary: Claire's alone. The gray sky pours endlessly, weighing her down. She reflects on everything that has happened so far. She feels scared and hopeless and small. But... what's that? A small but bright flame glows within her still. Claire chooses to DREAM her own dream, to think positively and not think about all the messed up things that are happening. In resonance, the sky opens and sunlight peeks through. With DREAM power, Claire brings fleeting life into the city of statues and ruin.

#BGM (ambience)

It's a low point.

Claire is laying down in the middle of a puddle. The rain has since caught on. The atmosphere is grey and bleak; she gets up.

[Claire]
(mumbling)
**The Mirror...**

The drizzle floats in the air, swayed by wind. Claire walks slowly, unmotivated. Torn buildings and giant swords tower in the distance. Cockcrow Peak, and part of the castle, can be seen far.

(APD) Claire presses on, taking breaks to push whatever debris is on her way.

You can follow the tram line into the city. There's a navigational puzzle here where the rails show the correct place to go (since it's the path the tram would've taken). There are several strange misplaced status across the greyscale plaza. Strangely detailed frogs frozen in time. Claire has to drag her boots across the puddles on the floor, no longer trying to maintain herself dry.

Interacting with them, narration reads "For a moment... you thought you saw the statue... breathe?" There are several closed (some barricaded) buildings. Nobody's home.

Then, on the corner of her eye, she sees a girl in a yellow dress seemingly cleaning one of the statues.

[Claire]
A... girl?

The kid is startled and looks at Claire, squinting through the mist. Claire does a little wave. The girl stares at her for a second, then unceremoniously turns away and leaves.

[&]
W... wait!

Claire steps forth on to the next room but the girl has already vanished.

[&]
Dang it...

A little bit forward, the only path is blocked by two heavy statues.

[Claire]
(sarcastically)
Great.

On her own, Claire walks around and sits down at a bench besides a frog statue.
She sits for a minute.

[Claire]
So... Let's see...
The school's been taken over by... whatever...
I found a portal to a parallel world...
The world is going to end... and I'm some sort of guide or hero...
(she smiles)
This is the weirdest dream I've ever had.
I can't wait to wake up from it though.

A moment passes.

[Claire]
(mimicking british accent)
Bit of rain, innit?

Claire looks at the statue beside her.

[Claire]
If I'm complaining of the cold,
You must have it even worse, huh, stone man?
What are you, a frog?

Claire looks at it.

[Claire]
This place is so gloomy, eh...

A brief pause.

[&]
You know what?
(smiling determinedly)
If this is my dream... if this is my story... I'll...
I'll DREAM my own dream now.

Narration reads "However small, a strange feeling resonates within you."

When the player chooses the pulsating rainbow option, Claire will close her eyes, smile and open her arms. She stays there for a moment, feeling the rain. Then, suddenly, the clouds open partly, letting a growing pillar of sunlight in. The statue rumbles and then in a flash, the town area flashes into partial colour tile by tile (like in a GBC game).

The frog kid blinks twice, feels its body and does a surprised expression.

[Kid Frog]
(croak)
Holy marsh!

[Claire]
Huh—?

[Kid Frog]
You!!

The frog jumps in front of her.

[Kid Frog]
H- hi! Are you a h- h- human???

[Claire]
Yes?

[Kid Frog]
Woah! Wo- wo- woah! I haven't seen a human folk in ages! Th- thanks for bringing me back, yo!

[Claire]
I... did this?

[Kid Frog]
I'm gonna tell everybody in town!

The kid frog hops away. The city, while still raining, is somewhat more lively now, filled with some blues and greens.

#BGM Aurora

(APD) You can walk forward. There are statues still blocking the way. You know the drill, it's to use DREAM on them. They turn into TESTY TOAD.

[Testy Toad]
Gah! Outrageous!
(ribbit)
I'm... Awake???

He notices Claire.

[&]
My colour came back and I don't know what to do!!!
Tell what, for all that's worth, I'm gonna take my confusion out on you!!!

[Claire]
What? Why???

#VS Testy Toad. You can Talk or DREAM to soothe him. Giving him some moon cola also works. You can also murder him I guess.
#BGM Battle Incoming!

[Testy Toad]
I'm awfully sorry, little one.
I just haven't had my morning coffee in... Well...

[Claire]
(smiling)
Get outta here!!!!

[Testy Toad]
Will do! Will do!

He hops away.

Going forth into the alley, Claire runs into two lizard ladies you can use DREAM on.

#VS Lizard Lady A, Lizard Lady B

Upon defeat (by ACTing) they will say:

[Lizard Lady A]
Oh, I'm sssss-sorry dearie!

[Lizard Lady B]
I'm awfully sssss-sorry, yeah!

[Lizard Lady A]
You came in hopping, we thought we saw a frog!
And that the frog was you!

[Lizard Lady B]
We don't like frogs... we renounce them!

[Claire]
I'm... um... not a frog.

[Lizard Lady B]
Ssss-say, what are you? We can't tell.

[Claire]
I'm uh... a human...

[Lizard Lady A]
Oh! Of course!
Pardon me, I haven't ssss-seen a human in agessss!

[Lizard Lady B]
Ssss-say, are you a boy human or a girl human, little one?

[Claire]
I'm a girl!

[Lizard Lady A]
A girl human? How exxxxquisite!

== The Ruined City ==
Summary: Claire navigates through the city, bringing life wherever she goes with the power of her DREAM. She can feel herself connecting to her inner Hero already, kindly helping Somni in the city.

(APD) You walk through an alley. In there, The Mystery Kid and Pierre stand suspiciously.

[The Mystery Kid]
Howdy, it's me, everybody's favourite child of indeterminate gender!!! Your one and only host!!!
Oh, may I say you look dashing today, my dear, absolutely soaked in elegance?

[Claire]
(britishly)
Oh, nothing that a small drizzle of absolutely pouring rain can't do!

[The Mystery Kid]
Haven't pet the cat in a while, have you?

[Pierre]
Hey, Claire! You know you can talk to me even if you're *not* anxious, right?

[Claire]
What difference does it make if I'm anxious all the time.

[Pierre]
Touché...
But also, have at me!!!

#SAVE Game is saved here.

// Save points have whimsical narration usually, but there's never any narration or flavour text if The Mystery Kid is on screen since they are the narrator and that's not supposed to be obvious on a first playthrough.

[The Mystery Kid]
Oh, what a great team we make, the three of us.
Say this, love, I'm really proud of what we've built together. You help me, I help you...

[Claire]
You haven't helped me at all!!!

[The Mystery Kid]
What??? Who was there with you all this time? When you were doing puzzles? Commiting arson? Fighting frogs (sic)?

[Claire]
(baffled)
Not you!

[The Mystery Kid]
(offended)
Well, I'm DONE helping you, since THAT's how it's gonna be. Hmpf.

[Claire]
You have been of no help whatsoever???

[The Mystery Kid]
(offended 2, the sequel)
Gasp!
(putting their fists out in a goofy fighting stance)
That's it! I'm not gonna take such ingratitude to my face! Bring it on, Claire!

// Prompt here.
// You can choose "Bring It On" or "Leave It Off"

// If you choose "Bring It On", you can fight them!

[Claire]
(smiling, whispering)
*This is a bit, right?*

[The Mystery Kid]
(smiling, whispering)
*Yeah!*

[Claire]
Well, uh, in this case, I will, uh... forsake you!!!

[The Mystery Kid]
Well, then, time to teach you some respect. Prepare to be destroyed in combat!

[Claire]
Yeah, ha ha. You're...
(serious)
Still joking, right?

A brief pause.

#TRANS Battle flicker
#VS The Mystery Kid

[The Mystery Kid]
Get got!

The Mystery Kid throws a single, very slowly rotating card at you.

// There is no "narration" during this battle, only TMK commenting as themselves.

[Claire]
Huh?

[The Mystery Kid]
That was my attack! :D

[Claire]
You can't just throw one card at me and call that an attack.

[The Mystery Kid]
Why not?
FINE. Okay.
(wink)
Alright, get ready for my next turn then.

You can choose actions here.

// If you choose 'Pose':

[The Mystery Kid]
Cool! Dunno why you did that but sure!

// If you choose 'Hug' you can hug them:

[The Mystery Kid]
Awww... are you saying goodbye since you're going to die?

Next turn, they throw *two* very slowly rotating cards at her.

[Claire]
Huh???

[The Mystery Kid]
What now???

[Claire]
Oh, come on! Don't just send two cards either! I can take more than this!

[The Mystery Kid]
I'm taking it easy on you since you're a girl :)

[Claire]
I'm a g— You're— three freaking years old???

[The Mystery Kid]
Oh. I see.

Your have a turn here, etc.

The Mystery Kid throws a single slowly rotating card again... but, before it can even hit you, an assortment of random bullets — fire, dice, tokens, move through the bullet board at insane speeds. Then the slowly moving card completes its journey through the bullet board and off screen.

[Claire]
...

[The Mystery Kid]
Alright this fills my legally mandated screen-time quota for this act. Let's call it a truce, okay? I'm going to Spare you now!

You can then Spare them.

// Some battle notes: being hit by normal bullets deal 1 damage per bullet.
// Being hit by any of the cards deals 999 damage, and kills you instantly.
// If you somehow do survive after being hit, The Mystery Kid just says "I love strong women :)".
// Not sparing them or hitting them prompts them to say "Do you need ACTing lessons?" or "Don't hit me I'm a baby :-("
// It's impossible to kill them no matter how much you hit them.

[The Mystery Kid]
Huff... Puff... Oh boy, what a workout!
Well, I hope you've learn your lesson!

[Claire]
...

[The Mystery Kid]
Alright, here's the deal.
Look at this.

TMK rotate-shrinks until only their top hat is left. Then, they jump back into their normal form.

[The Mystery Kid]
I'm gonna be leaving these top hats around... If you need a tip, just give it a tap!
To help get, tap the tip top hat, got it?

[Claire]
Yeah.

[The Mystery Kid]
Tippity-tappity bye!

The Mystery Kid vanishes into their top hat.

// You can interact with it again.

[Claire]
Where did they go...

[The Mystery Kid]
Aaaaaaaaand the audience screams Encore!!!

[Claire]
Uh... Do you have a tip?

[The Mystery Kid]
A tip? I _just_ gave you one??? About top-hats???

[Claire]
Well, give me another!

[The Mystery Kid]
Sure! Keep an eye on your "HP" — if that number reaches "0"... you will "die."

[Claire]
I already knew that!

[The Mystery Kid]
Well, it's a great thing to keep in mind, no?

A brief pause.

[The Mystery Kid]
Eeesh. Tough crowd...
Yet the show must go on.
Claire: geddaoutta here!

Then they revert to a top-hat again.

If you save now, narration reads.

#SAVE Knowing that this strange child has your back... Your SOUL glimmers with HOPE.

On the other side of the alley, in the marketplace, amphibians and reptiles of all kinds are having beef with each other.

A merchant, [[Drapery Drake]], a shifty-looking dragon, is crying as toads run around its shop.

[Drapery Drake]
Oh how I wish one!!!
Would drive the toads away!!!
I'd give them wares!!!
(Provided they'd pay)

You can hop in here and fight the two toads that are harassing the poor guy. You can also just move on lmao, but he will scream "Thou art just gonna leaveth me? f'rsake me?" and you can't leave.

[Drapery Drake]
Littlest one I thanketh thee dearly. Thee has't vindicat'd me in this matt'r...

[Claire]
Glad to help, sir.

[Drapery Drake]
May I p'rhaps off'r: something in returneth?
Aye. aye. Prithee, littlest, shall thee participateth on a dram game?

// You can choose to not participate. If so he'll just say "Pleaseth" each time until you accept.

[Claire]
Sure!

#TRANS Battle flicker

#BGM Buy Something, Will Ya?

#CAM In first person view, though still in colour.

[Drapery Drake]
Heareth the game rules:
yond way thee'll playeth most best. 
Findeth the jewel once, twice, thrice
and a prize thee'll winneth fast!

D.D. stuffs the jewel under one of the three hats and shuffles them once. But, because the three hats are completely distinct from one another — a baseball cap, a helmet and a top-hat (which has the gem), it's trivial to find where the jewel is.

[Drapery Drake]
Remarkable luck!
the jewel thee has't hath found!
shalt thee findeth t again,
in this nexth comingeth round?

She shall. She does.

[Drapery Drake]
I'm quite bewitched!
thou art quite artful!
findeth the jewel once m're;
thy pockets shall beest full!

He lowers the hat one more time, and shuffles it WITH PASSION. Claire points to the correct hat immediately. But.

The music cuts. The top hat starts going up slowly with a matching whistle noise, revealing a very thing scaled The Mystery Kid inside. When the top hat reaches its zenith, TMK's sprite expands and their theme blasts at full volume.

#BGM The Mystery Kid

[The Mystery Kid]
Goood evening, folks!

The dragon shivers horrified in the corner.

[&]
Are you in the middle of something? You tapped the tophat THREE whole times so you definitely intended to summon me...

[&]
Well I have a tip for ya that will add just a DASH of excitement to your battles...
Heheheh... puns...

Whenever you see its beautiful purple, remember of trying for (Z)!

Really, try it now!

Claire does a dash!

[Claire]
OH, WOAH!
Holy macaroni...

[The Mystery Kid]
Yes! You got it! Claire's **purple** and her "Warp Dash."
So, keep that in mind.

[The Mystery Kid]
Purple — Dash!

Then they disappear into their hat.

[Drapery Drake]
A- are they gone???

[Claire]
I think so.

[Drapery Drake]
I'm sorry. I'll... I'll... Uh...
The shope is did close!

D.D. slides off screen.

Throughout the city, there will be many frogs and lizards fighting each other. Talking to them offer a bunch of different dialogue.

[City Toad]
People in the city might seem cold at first, but they're friendly, I tell you!
Learn to ACT the right way, in and out of battles, and they might even give you directions.

[Claire]
Acting...

[City Toad]
Just one of the things to keep in mind while walking around.

//TODO: Write the battles here and the funny conflicts between the frogs and the lizard factions. Frogs like coffee, lizards like tea, etc.

== The Garden Gate ==
Summary: Claire approaches the thresholds of the kingdom, her way out of this otherworld. A dog guard judges her character by giving her a test. She passes, but, oh, no... It seems the life she has brought into the city didn't last very long. Rushing in comes the clouds and takes everything away. Claire puts on a smile and chooses to go on.

(APD) Stepping away from the busy parts of the city, Claire smiles at the colourful sight she's leaving behind. She arrives at the garden gate.

There's a sign by the gate that reads "Aurora Royal Garden. Humans Welcome!"
There's a smaller sign that reads "Formerly" written in red sharpie. 

[Claire]
(smiling)
A dog!

[Canine Guard]
Woof! Woof woof!

[Claire]
Hey! Don't be like that!
You're a good boy, aren't you?

[Canine Guard]
Me? I guess?

[Claire]
Oh, you can talk—

[Canine Guard]
Don't patronize me, human.
(realises)
Oh, is it you who's causing all this commotion?

[Claire]
Yes...

[Canine Guard]
It's now forbidden for humans to enter the royal garden...
But a human who can bring colour back...
Interesting...
(chuckles)
"Are you a good boy?" Ha.

[&]
Say what, let me ask you a better question.

#TRANS Battle flicker

[&]
Are YOU a good girl?

#VS Canine Guard
#BGM Battle Incoming!

The guard orders you to do some dog trick each turn.

//If you lower his HP enough, he'll stop being nice and attack you though.

[Canine Guard]
Human! Sit!

You're required to stand perfectly still in the battle board.

[Canine Guard]
Human! Roll!

Requires you to move around in circles.

[Canine Guard]
Human! Play dead!

Requires to you stand perfectly still again.

[Canine Guard]
Human... grab that stick! Grab it, grab it!

He tosses you a stick and you have to grab it before it flies out of frame.

// The stick should be a colour different from white to justify it not being harmful. Maybe yellow.

If you do it all well, the guard will spare you.

[Canine Guard]
Good girl! Good girl!

Narration reads "CG lowers his royal guard, sparing you."

// You can Spare him or FIGHT him here. If you haven't killed anyone so far, Claire will _refuse_ to do so now. Yeah, the game locks you into kindness around here.
// You see, Claire is her own person. At the start, you get to direct Claire towards different routes (the normal vs the alt route), but the alt route is "unstable" — you can always drop out of it. By the time you reach the garden, you might be locked out of the alt route.

#BGM Aurora

[Canine Guard]
Alright. Just so I know, what's your business in the city?

[Claire]
I'm looking for the exit? Um... "The Mirror"?

[Canine Guard]
Oh, you're trying to access your world, huh?

[Claire]
Yeah!

[Canine Guard]
Hm... Like I said before, it's not typically allowed for humans to visit the mirror shrine unaccompanied. But you ARE a very polite human...
(smiles)
Eh, I'll allow it!

The guard allows you through the gate.

[Claire]
(smiling)
Thank you so much!

[Canine Guard]
It is my pleasure.
I may escort you the way to the c...

The guard whimpers and falls to one knee.

[Claire]
What? What's wrong?

#TRANS Fade out to black, then fade in.

In the town, with Claire's absence, the sky begins to close again and a wave of gloom washes over everything... Not only that, each citizen turns into doodly monsters, similar to the Wadwasps from before.

#TRANS 80s campy lateral fade

[Canine Guard]
(whimpering)
It seems... Heh... Of course...
Well, it was nice while it lasted...

[Claire]
Are you... okay...

[Canine Guard]
Please don't hold it against me when I'm no longer...
A good boy...

He locks himself outside the gate. The colour slowly seeps from him and he turns bigger and spiky and mindless, and starts to claw at the gate, trying to reach Claire.

[Claire]
(sad)
This is...

A long pause. Then she turns around and compartmentalises.

[Claire]
(forced smile to mask the sad)
You got this, Claire.

(APD) Claire walks into the Garden.

== The Garden ==
Summary: At the heart of the ruined city, a garden lies surprisingly well-kept. What a delightful place to be in. Basket Knight, the groundskeeper is skeptical of you but chooses to help you— oh, oh no, why did you have to step on the bloody grass???

#BGM Overgrown

Walking a bit more, she eventually steps into a bed of flowers. Then she stops and looks around.

[Claire]
Woah...

[Basket Knight]
Oi! You!

#CAM Pan upward to reveal the girl from before was here just out of frame pickin' berries.

[&]
Yes! You there!

[Claire]
H... hi! I'm not a frog or a lizard!

[Basket Knight]
(narrow, disgusted eyes)
I know what you are...

[Claire]
Huh?

[Basket Knight]
(social smile)
Maybe you missed the sign, so I'll explain again:
Humans were, yes, formally well welcome in the royal garden...
But they're not allowed any longer!
So... go back to wherever you came from, and, uh safe travels!

[Claire]
H... hey wait!

The Basket Knight leaves the screen.

(APD) Claire presses on to the next room, where, as she's walking through the flowers, a Floradora jumps into a battle. Claire effortlessly befriends it by making it bloom with DREAM.

Then, to the right, there is a puzzle about pushing boulders and Rakestones to properly rake a tiny zen garden. A sign reads "Please leave the garden as tidy as you found it."

After the puzzle, a battle against two Floradoras and a Honibi.

In the next room, which is a field of flowers, the girl will be picking up lemons from a lemon tree.

[Basket Knight]
Ooo... These are smellin' good...
Slemin' good...
Slemon pie...

She puts some lemons in her basket.

[&]
There we go.

She turns around to leave and sees Claire.

[&]
Wh— You're still here?
What did I tell you?
Huuumans are NOT allowed in the castle!

[Claire]
Im not going to a castle,
Im looking for a mirror...

[Basket Knight]
Do you think I'm stupid???
The Mirror IS in the castle, everybody knows that!

[Claire]
Look, can't I... just stay a little bit?
Just so I can get on with this dream...

[Basket Knight]
Hm...
(sighing)
Okay, since you're so hopeless I'll show you where The Mirror is... IIIIF you promise to leave through it immediately...
Aaaand to not touch anything once we get there.
Except for The Mirror.
You can touch The Mirror.
Once. Gently.

[Claire]
I promise.

[Basket Knight]
(smiling)
Alrighty, let's get this over with.

She disappears to the next room.
When walking in the next room, you have to step on a flower when walking towards B.K.

[Basket Knight]
Alright, so we literally just have to follow this yellow brick road allllll the way to-

She turns to you.

[&]
Wha— I can't believe it! Do humans really have no respect for anything?

[Claire]
W... what did I do???

[Basket Knight]
You're stepping on the bloody flowers!

[Claire]
Oh. Oh. Well, they shouldn't be here, should they?

[Basket Knight]
In the flower garden???

[Claire]
I meant... In the...
(sneeze)
In the way...

[Basket Knight]
(narrow eyes)
I know your kind...
You think just because you're pretty and nice and good-smelling you don't have to take accountability, huh...

[&]
Know what? I've made my mind.
(pointing at Claire)
Human!
I'll devise a plan to foil your... boondogglery!!!
Bahaha.

She disappears into the next room.
Then she comes back.

[&]
(angry, flailing her arms)
And step out of the flowers!!!

Then she disappears again.

[Claire]
(thinking)
Why am I being bossed around by a blonde british child...

[Pierre]
Tell me about it!

// You can save in this room.
// Save dialog reads: "The air's saturated with the sour-sweet scent of citrus. Your SOUL shimmers with HOPE."

== The Garden (Chess Encounter) ==
Summary: Within the garden, some ruined knights walk about. They're corrupted but, they're soothed. Perhaps it's the sweet aroma of the flowers? These three nerd knights lightly harass you with their chess kerfuffle.

In the next room, there are three guards mid-argument. They are standing on a checkerboard flooring.

#CAM Pan to the right, leaving Claire almost out of frame.

[R Nerd]
No! YOU listen! I can move across the WHOLE board at once! Rooks rule!

[K Nerd]
So what? You can get blocked by your own pieces. Knights are stronger, faster, and unstoppabler (sic)!

[P Nerd]
Well, I think—

[R Nerd]
Shut up, "pawn"!

[P Nerd]
You underestimate the power of the humble pawn!
The pawn works hard to achieve its lifelong dreams!
It concerns itself not with immediate power... and thus they embody the biggest virtues of chess: Strategy, Patience!

[K Nerd]
Patience? Chess is a game of action and passion, yo!
It's about completely dominating your opponent with your sheer power! Kyahh!

[R Nerd]
What an impasse we find ourselves in. How I'd wish for someone new to come by...
Only an unbiased arbitre could settle this ancient dispute once and for all...
If only a foreigner, for example, a human, were to miraculously appear right before our very eyes this instant...

#CAM The camera slowly pans back to Claire.

Claire tries to sneak by, but she steps on a stick and makes noise.

[Claire]
H... Hello there?

An awkward pause.

[R Nerd]
Get her!

[K Nerd]
Whoever defeats the human in battle first is the victor!

[Claire]
W- w- w- wait!
D... Does it have to be a battle???
I mean, smart fellows like you surely—

[K Nerd]
What? The bullet board even has a checkerboard pattern!

[Claire]
The what—

#VS Chess Trio

Claire fights against the three nerds, which take turns attacking you with their chess pieces. It's the same as in the old prototype — R, K and P (in this order) have their pieces move according to the chess movement rules. The comedy in this battle comes from the fact that you'll struggle in R and K's turns, but P's moves are ridiculously easy to dodge.

Until, on the third turn, it'll reach the end of the board and start glowing. The battle pattern will be cut there, followed by one more turn of R and K. On the next P turn, the transformation concludes, the pawn becoming a queen with a dramatic sound and visual effect. Then, it rages through the battle board, possibly destroying you.

[R Nerd]
Unbelievable! The human has faced us and stood its ground!

[K Nerd]
What a remarkable warrior!

[P Nerd]
What a brilliant strategist.

[R Nerd]
It's settled. The... "Rose" is clearly the superior piece...
Here, human, take this as a sign of our gratitude.

Got 1x Red Tea.

[Claire]
Thank you!

// If you talk to P nerd after the fight.

[P Nerd]
A strange girl with a basked gives us treats sometimes.
I don't like tea, but I enjoy her visits.
Her voice is soothing.

// If you talk to R nerd after the fight.

[R Nerd]
Who are you?

// If you talk to K nerd after the fight.

// If you've defeated GYMBRO.

[K Nerd]
Ah, what a mighty warrior I see before me!

// If you've sided with GYMBELLE.

[K Nerd]
Ah, what an elegant sight graces my eyes.

//TODO: I realise GYMBRO AND GYMBELLE haven't been mentioned in this draft yet.

APD Claire presses on.

== The Basket Knight ==
Summary: And then comes Basket Knight who hates your guts and vows to kill you, all throughout resulting in mild inconvenience. Claire responds with positivity and politeness, making BK absolutely livid.

.[[Basket Knight]] stands atop a wall and looks at you from up there.

#BGM Royal Nuisance

[Basket Knight]
Oi! Human!
Since you've chosen to continue to invade this site...
I have no option but to put an end to your tyranny...
Bahahaha!

She throws, from her basket, a single Floradora and throws it on the ground (gently).

[Basket Knight]
Behold! My troop!

[Floradora]
*flower noises*

[Basket Knight]
I'm sorry for this, human, but, like I said, no other choice.

#VS Floradora. You can defeat it easily. Like, it's not any harder than a normal Floradora encounter.

[Basket Knight]
What??? How'd you???
(ahem-ing)
I mean... Yes! Of course! I was merely testing your strength!
We're just getting warmed up, bahaha!
The real challenge... is up ahead!!!

She marches out of frame.

APD Claire may follow her.

[Basket Knight]
Greetings! It is I! Et cetera!
So yeah, you can defeat ONE Floradora!
But... can you—

[Claire]
Let me guess... You're gonna throw TWO flower buds at me?

[Basket Knight]
What? Two measly Floradoras? Do you take me for an idiot?

[Claire]
Oh. Oh no sorry, it was just—
Alright, what will you do then?

[Basket Knight]
Bahahah! You're about to find out! Have at ya!

She throws three Floradoras at you.

#VS Floradora A, Floradora B, Floradora C

After you defeat (befriend) them she's gonna be surprised.

[Basket Knigt]
How'd you— What'd you—

[Claire]
They're my friends now.

[Basket Knight]
Look at what you did to the poor things!
They're stupid now!

[Claire]
They're vibing... Come vibe with us!

[Basket Knight]
NO!!!
I haven't given up on defeating you yet!
I'll find an even MORE threatening enemy to destroy you! Just you wait!
Bahahahahaha— COUGH COUGH... Ughh....
(cutely)
Bu-bye~!

She leaves the room.

== Mad Tea Party ==
Where: Aurora/Royal Garden
Summary: A true respite within the ruins. Some corrupted cityfolk enjoy delicious human tea. You may have some yourself. What? You're on danger of being impaled and killed??? That's no reason to interrupt their tea time, silly!

In this room, there is a small tea stand, and, to its side, an ornate table, with several bleaked characters drinking tea:

// Here we have [[Dolores]], [[Tea Frog]], [[Tea Bunny]], [[The Mystery Kid]] and and [[Pierre]].

There's a sign which reads "Cuppa Dream — Aurora's finest tea shop."

%IF Talking to Dolores:

[Dolores]
Oh, hi there, sweetie!
Are you a h-h-h-h-h-h-
What an excellent story! You sure have been on a journey!!!

[Claire]
I haven't said anything...

[Dolores]
Please enjoy some tea, will you?
It's Aurora's finest!

%IF Talk to her again:

[Dolores]
My husband usually accompanies me to these events...
His name is Tommy... Terrence?
He's a little late, but, when he arrives he will tell you alllll about his banking job...

%IF Talk to tea frog:

[Tea Frog]
Ribbit!
Unlike those brutes back in town, I've turned gray! But I haven't turned uncivilised!
(whispering)
Please don't tell anyone back there... that I secretly love tea...
Master Chayin's tea is not that great... but these aracnisser smuggle the good stuff from the Physical Realm!

%IF Talk to tea bunny:

[Tea Bunny]
Purrrr!!!

%IF Talk to The Mystery Kid:

[The Mystery Kid]
Hey there, Claire!
Check this out: an Aracnisse, like a cat, can cross the barrier between worlds... so the items you buy from this stand are _actually_ real...

[Claire]
Interesting...

[The Mystery Kid]
I know, right? Now, if you excuse me, I have a tea party to return to.

%IF Talk to them again:

[The Mystery Kid]
These fine folks were transformed, too, but they retained their class!

[Dolores]
Of course! Unlike those brutes of Aurora, we wouldn't let ourselves be undermined by such a barbaric disease. They were c-c-c-corrupted by the sickness...
As for me, my mind is perfectly fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-
Hey, human! Didn't see you there! Would you care for a cuppa?

#SAVE "The aroma of a tea party for odd folks in a dying kingdom. Your SOUL glimmers with HOPE."

To the right of the tea party, framed by bushes, there's a standing door.
Flavour text reads: "There is a door here. It's locked from the other side."

On the other side of the room, there are some old, worn, giant teacups filled with rain and mud. One of them, an axolotl is using it as a bathtub.

%IF Talking to him:

[Axolotl]
Ahhhh...

The tea shop sells Red Tea and Ice Tea, as well as Star Cookies.
%IF you buy an item it'll remark "Tiny spiders wearing pointy hats pour your tea with some effort. They reassure you you can keep the cup."

Walking to the right, there will be two knight statues ([[Shovel Knight]] and [[Bucket Knight]]) blocking the way. Using DREAM on them wakes them up, but they attack you.

#VS Shovel Knight, Bucket Knight

You can see the odd folks continuing to have their tea party while you're being impaled to death <3. During battle, narration will remark The Mystery Kid cheering for you and offering no help.

== Basket Knight Is At It Again ==
Summary: The Basket Knight is at it again!

The Basket Knight is at it again!

[Basket Knight]
Greetings! Hi! Hello!

[Claire]
Hiii!

[Basket Knight]
Ready to die???

[Claire]
Sure!

[Basket Knight]
Bahahaha no you're not! Get her, boys!

#VS Honibi A, Honibi B

During battle, narration will remark that "For some reason, they seem very interested in Claire's SOUL." I think you can let them pollinate you. You can also flirt with them for some reason. They are easily defeated.

%IF Normal win

[Basket Knight]
STOP!!! BEFRIENDING THE ENEMY!!!

[Claire]
I can't help it, it's so cute!!!

[Basket Knight]
And stop calling it cute!!!

[Claire]
Never!!!

[Basket Knight]
(steam coming outta her head like a teapot)
GAH!!!

%IF you flirted with any of them

[Basket Knight]
Stop flirting with the enemies!!!

[Claire]
But it's so cute! Look at it it's so fat!

[Basket Knight]
It's a bloody bee you're flirting at (sic)!
Are you really that lonely!

[Claire]
No!
(thinking)
I mean...
(shrug)
Maybe?

Either way, BK jumps into the arena and shoos the bees away.

[Basket Knight]
Get out of here you traitors. Go back to your pens!!!

Then she turns to you.

[Basket Knight]
En garde.

[Claire]
Huh?

[Basket Knight]
If even my loyal bees with betray me...
Then I'll have to dispatch you myself.

[Claire]
Oh.

[Basket Knight]
That's right. Have. At. Ya!!!!!

She then starts to run at you as the battle flicker threatens to trigger the battle transition... but then she trips and falls face first in the dirt, sliding up to Claire's feet and leaving a long dirt trail.

%IF Interacting with her:

[Basket Knight]
...

%IF And again

[Basket Knight]
I... Just go on... I need a moment...

(APD) Claire moves on.

You reach a place with denser vegetation and, in the middle of it, a single table with a slice of lemon pie on it.

%IF you try to walk past it without eating it:

[Basket Knight]
The human tried to leave... but she couldn't resist the sweet moldy scent of lemon pie...

[Narrator]
Hey!!!

%IF you try to leave again:

[Basket Knight]
The human tried to leave again... but her nose spoke louder and she could not!!!

[Narrator]
Apparently... someone's coming for my job...

%IF you interact with it.

[Basket Knight]
A-ha!

[Claire]
How'd you get here so fast!

[Basket Knight]
Well, you see, I— Well that doesn't matter!
What matters is: you fell into my deadly trap!!!
Bahahahahaha!!!

[Claire]
Oh, cool. What's it hooked up to?

[Basket Knight]
It—

A slight pause.

[&]
I... Um...
(annoyed)
Booger....

[Claire]
Language!!!

[Basket Knight]
(flustered)
S... sorry...

She lowers herself into the bush.

(APD) On to the next room.

There's a short maze made of prickly rose hedges here containing items, but also a few encounters against Honibis, Bundlebees, Floradoras, and Prickle, all lost in the maze. Pierre is also lost in the maze. You can't save with him because he's too anxious himself.

Basket Knight sits atop a wall on the side of the maze.

[Claire]
You made this whole hedge in five seconds?

[Basket Knight]
Nope! It was already here! 
But I lured you into it, bahahaha!
The Scissor Knight rearranges it into a new shape every day since she's gone mad...
Not even I know how to solve it...
There's no way you can escape!!! I could laugh in your face!!!

[&]
(smiling)
Wait, I can!

She puts her basket by her side, then she jumps down from the wall and walks to be in front of Claire.

[Basket Knight]
Bahahahahahaha!

Then she steps back.

[Basket Knight]
Anyways, I got errands to run... And...

She looks to one side, looks to another...

[Basket Knight]
Oh...

She looks at Claire, flustered, adjusting her dress' skirt.

[Basket Knight]
*ahem*

A brief pause.

[Claire]
Yes...

[Basket Knight]
So... Um... We're... Uh... Stuck together... And... Um...

She extends a hand to you.

[&]
How about... we call it a truce? But just for now!

[Claire]
Sure!

[Basket Knight]
Yippie! I mean... I'm totally gonna kick your butt later, so don't get too used to it.
(remembers)
Me basket!!!

She walks towards the wall where her basket is and does two little pathetic jumps to try to get to it.

[Basket Knight]
Don't just stand there!!!

[Claire]
Oh.

You can walk up to her, Claire will hold her by her waist and raise her above her head. Basket Knight picks up her basket.

[Basket Knight]
Now unhand me at once!!!

Claire lowers her.

[Basket Knight]
Alright. You solve the maze, now!!!

%IF you talk to BK.

During the maze, you'll be attacked by Scissor Knight. It'll be complaining that someone stole its "Seamstress Scissors." BK will be like "nobody stole your scissors Scis, lets go to bed."

// This unassuming, throwaway detail is a hint to what's happening in the real world, for the mystery that will be properly established in Episode 02.
// That is, it's the Scissor Knight's Seamstress Scissors that FK and MK use to open tears.

== Truce and Lull ==
Summary: Claire and Basket Knight catch their breath after fighting against more ruined knights and watching the bees get unleashed into the garden. They get inside, drink some warm tea and talk about their situations. Maybe the human isn't so bad after all...

On the next room, Claire will fight [[Rake Knight]] and [[Can Knight]]. BK will be backseat-gaming during the battle criticising your actions.

#VS Rake Knight, Can Knight

[Basket Knight]
Don't take it to heart, okay...
They're not aware of their actions...
Before they turned gray they were very...

[&]
Well, they were very annoying... But they sure did looove humans.

Then it starts to rain.

[Basket Knight]
Bloody hell... Let's get moving.

To the left, there's BK's home — a cute house inside a huge mushroom. By its side, there's a fenced area with a feeding through (filled with an assortment of flowers) and a water bucket.

The Honibis are all buzzing around, outside their pen.

[Basket Knight]
Huh? Hey!
(flailing her arms)
Get back to your pen! You're gonna get wet!

The Honibis don't listen.

[Claire]
Maybe you should take a break?
You seem to be working hard...

[Basket Knight]
(tired)
Bahaha... If I take a break this place will grey out in five minutes...

[Claire]
It rains a lot in here, doesn't it... aren't you cold?

[Basket Knight]
Mmm...
Alright. Let's do a tactical retreat.
But afterwards, we have to work twice as hard.

[Claire]
Sure, commander!

[Basket Knight]
Captain*!

[Claire]
Let's go.

They go into her house.

#BGM (ambience)

You can hear just the sound of the rain hitting the roof top. The lighting is soft. It's cozy, like a lazy summer afternoon.

[Claire]
Your house is cute...

[Basket Knight]
Feel free to look around; don't touch anything.
Sit down when you feel like it.

[Claire]
I'll touch the stool. With my butt.

[Basket Knight]
(flustered)
Whatever.

%IF you interact with the fridge:

[Basket Knight]
That's my refrigerator. It's where you put things to— you know what a bloody refrigerator is...

%IF you interact with the fridge again, narration remarks "It's full of individually wrapped slices of lemon pie. Take one?"

%IF you say yes:

"Got 1x Lemon Pie Slice."

[Basket Knight]
Put it back, you thief!

"Lost 1x Lemon Pie Slice."

%IF you interact with the hammock:

[Basket Knight]
Sleeping grounds.
After a day of service, is where I get knocked out.
Don't sit on it, you're wet.

%IF you interact with the oven:

[Basket Knight]
This is the mechanical oven.
It's where you of in the cold food.

[Claire]
This isn't gonna come alive and attack me, will it?

[Basket Knight]
What?
Is that a human thing?

%IF you finally sit your ass down:

[Basket Knight]
Oh! Where are my manners?

Basket Knight puts a teapot in the stove-top, then cranks a little winding mechanism to turn on the fire. The teapot begins to heat up. Basket Knight walks over to her basket (it's on the counter top), gets two whole lemons, walks back and puts them inside the teapot.

[Claire]
Why don't you move your arms when you walk... Are you a robot?

[Basket Knight]
Robot? Ha! I'm an automaton!
No electricity or coal in here...

[Claire]
It's very steampunk...

[Basket Knight]
There is no steam!!!
It's clockwork allll the way down.
Winding mechanisms... levers... gears...

[Claire]
Oh... is that what that thing on your back is for?

// BK's design has a winding mechanism on her lower back, which passes for a bow.

[Basket Knight]
Yes...

Basket Knight gets the teapot and pours your tea on a little cup.

[Basket Knight]
Now for some honey...

Basket Knight squirts honey onto the cup for five whole seconds. Then she sits down and hands your cup.

[Basket Knight]
There you go.

Narration remarks "You take a sip of the tea. It tastes disgusting."

[Claire]
Wait, doesn't that mean that one day you'll run out of winding and die?

[Basket Knight]
So what? You'll get old and die too!

[Claire]
Oh. Oh yeah.

[Basket Knight]
Plus, if someone rewinds my escapement I could live indefinitely...

[Claire]
Until you rust...

[Basket Knight]
Stop reminding me of my mortality!!!

[Claire]
He he... death...

For a moment, they stop talking, and nothing can be heard but the rain.

[Basket Knight]
You know... It's kinda.... nice having a house guest.
Even if it's a human.

A slight pause.

[Basket Knight]
It can get lonely here some times...

[Claire]
Do you... not have parents?

[Basket Knight]
Not quite. I mean, there's our creator?
He seemed to like when I called him dad.
But... that was a while ago...

[Claire]
He left you here all alone?

[Basket Knight]
Stuff happens.
There were the other knights, too...
They were kinda like family, I guess...
They were *sigh* supposed to be at least...

A brief pause.

[Basket Knight]
They'd say I wasn't a "real knight"
because "you're too sweet" and "you can't use that as a weapon"...
(angry)
One of them has a bloody bucket! That's like 80% basket!!!

[&]
We never did any fighting anyways...
We just kept taking care of the garden...
When the sickness came, none of them could ward it off.
Jokes on them, now I'M the captain! Haha...

The rain ceases, BK stands up and walks away while mumbling.

[Basket Knight]
Rain's gone. Let's get those bees before it freaking starts again. I swear to heavens, it's every five minutes...

[Claire]
This place would be less depressing with some merrier weather...

// This is a callback to the future. To Juniper Merryweather, a character that will be met in [[Episode 05]].

[Basket Knight]
Tell me about it.

%IF you interact with the fridge now:

"Through unwielding will, you have successfully won the long game."
"Got 1x Lemon Slice Pie."

%IF you finally go outside.

#BGM Overgrown

[Basket Knight]
Alright.

She tries to pull one bee that's very interested in a flower, but it doesn't budge. Her pulling animation has two frames it alternates between choppily.

[&]
What are you standing there for?
Help me put them back in their pen!

Little minigame. You can grab bees by pressing Z and throw them in their pen. Some of them trigger a little bullet board microgame when you touch them, so be careful! When you win, BK will suplex her own bee into the pen.

[Basket Knight]
Alright, let's see...
One... Two... Three... Four... Oh, crikey, where's Dexter...

Basket Knight goes down and looks around. As she turns away from the pen, all the bees start slowly flying over the fence.

[Basket Knight]
It's probably not far from here...
(sigh)
I don't know how they keep getting out.
Let's go get that bastard.

Basket Knight runs to the right. Since it's no longer raining, Pierre is here.

// Saving narration reads: "With resilience and determination, the little girl continues to care for the garden. Your SOUL sparkles with HOPE."

Claire goes to the right.

== The Price Paid ==
Summary: Claire's hesitance back in the tram had consequences. From the woods, emerges a corrupted Prof. Whynott, the Knight's creator, who "attacks" the girls. Basket Knight remembers why she despises the humans so much.

#BGM (silence)

There's a long corridor... the floor is dirt, the walls are the stems of giant flowers. Rain drips from the giant leaves.

[Basket Knight]
There, there... What's gotten into you...

// If you talk to BK...

[Basket Knight]
Something's startled it... If it is one of the guards again I'll have a strong word with them... But... I don't know...

Walking more to the right... from the leaves, a corrupted figure jumps. As they turn their head to you, you can make it out. It's [[Professor Whynott]].

[Claire]
N... no...

[Basket Knight]
Did you find what s— Oh... D... dad?

Basket Knight walks to Professor Whynott's right and grabs his sleeve.

[Basket Knight]
Can you... Hey...

#TRANS Battle Flicker
#BGM Bleak Battle (slowed)

During battle, the background goes dark.

Whynott attacks you with patterns similar to Baker Owen, trying to smash you with tools or machinery. His patterns are easy, and repetitive, but fast and deadly. You will probably need to *DASH* out of the way to survive. He mutters some nonsense about contraptions and other things...

// "...an excellent idea..."
// "...gone haywire!"
// "...a terrible idea..."
// "...tram... listen... the plan..."
// "...want... see her again..."
// "...please... pain..."
// "...the sickness..."

// You can defeat him by DREAM easily.
// "You dreamt of your bed at the end of a long day."

#BGM (silence)

After calming him down, the professor turns into smoke and wanders into the leaves aimlessly. A moment of silence.

Basket Knight gets up, grabs Dexter, and with her back facing you...

[Basket Knight]
Our truce.

A slight pause.

[Basket Knight]
It's over.

She walks right out of frame.

== Versus The Basket Knight ==
Summary: Claire fights The Basket Knight, who tries to aggressively kill you with flower petals. She hates how fake and dishonest humans are. How they do horrible things and lie to themselves to justify their wrongdoings. Claire must drop her façade and admit to her anxiety and dismay, the emotional honesty gaining Basket Knight's trust.

Claire gets closer to the garden's front entrance. There's a stone path that cuts through a lake. A sign reads "Welcome, humans! Please take as much as you need from the garden!" At the path's center, a gazebo.

When Claire reaches the center of the gazebo, where several flowers and fruits in sacs reside, Basket Knight comes from behind you.

[Basket Knight]
We built this place for them...

Winds begin to blow leaves around.

[&]
Tired travellers could come by and take a rest... Eat some pie... Smell the flowers...
Humans are always on some adventure, aren't they?
Struggling to grow or whatever...

Basket Knight walks past you, looking away from you, towards the entrance.

[&]
When we opened this up... we were waiting for masses of people to come by...

A slight pause.

[&]
They never did...
The people who did come made a mockery of this world.
Stepped in the grass. Plucked petals out of Floradoras...
Took several candies from the "take one" tray... then threw the wrappers in the lake...

[Claire]
(empathy smile)
I'm sorry that these jerks came but...

[Basket Knight]
(smiling)
No...
Ha ha.
They weren't jerks...
Humans aren't evil... I sometimes like to pretend they are, but...
(smiling sad)
Maybe all they needed was the fun of not caring for a little while.

[&]
Nice people do horrible things all the time.
We asked them to stop; and they just...
And we couldn't bring ourselves to yell at them...
We were desperate for their visits, weren't we?
Humans think that a polite smile and a positive attitude will make everything okay.

She looks at you.

[&]
Looking at you fake-smile your way through the garden, all huggy-lovey just now...
It reminds me of them.

[Claire]
I'm not... fake-smiling...

She looks away from you again.

[Basket Knight]
Lie to yourself all you want, I've learned to see through it all.
Or are you really suddenly THAT cheerful while being soaking wet, stranded in an alien, dying world?

[Claire]
...

[Basket Knight]
I don't know what you want to do in our castle.
And I don't care about how you'll justify to yourself that you're in the right.
(tearing up)
And there's barely anything left in this place from back then to protect...
(serious)
But as the captain of the crown's guard...
I won't let a human take any more from me...
(smiling daringly)
Step forward.
If you dare.

(APD) You can step forward.

[Basket Knight]
En garde.

#VS The Basket Knight

// This is the first serious battle.
// And it's the first battle that can not be won through being nice and positive. To befriend Basket Knight, you have to be open with your negative feelings, and allow her to be negative, too.

#BGM Overgrown

[Basket Knight]
(teary eyed, smiling)
You really are genuinely that nice...
Why?
Are you stupid?
You're gonna be eaten alive out there.
Not everything can be solved by giving out hugs, you know...
It doesn't matter how nice you are, you're bound to find a fight you can't win by befriending the enemy.
Eventually, you'll have to FIGHT...

[Claire]
I hugged you because you're nice.
I can punch jerks when it comes to it.

[Basket Knight]
Fighting jerks is easy.
Fighting people you like, though...
I couldn't bring myself to use my full power on you, and look what happened, I lost.
(smiling)
But I'm glad you're not dead on the ground, I guess.

[Claire]
...

[Basket Knight]
The castle is... well, just across from the entrance, really.
I'm... sorry, I'm so tired... you can go to the shrine on your own...

Basket Knight walks past you, looking despondent.

[Claire]
Are you... going back to gardening?

[Basket Knight]
Maybe I'll take that break you told me to.
Taking care of this garden... that nobody visits... ha ha...

She walks until she's just out of frame, then stops.

[Basket Knight]
What for?

Then leaves.

[Claire]
...

// If you return to the tunnel, the one that leads to this area, you'll find an item on the ground. "It's a winding key."

(APD) Claire exits the garden through the main entrance.

#BGM Liminal

To the left, an empty pier, no boats docked. The ocean is grey and uneasy.

To the right, a tram station. A tram is crashed there.

Up ahead, the Castle of Dawn.

(APD) Claire puts her hands on the large doors. As she pushes on it, an imposing fanfare builds up as the screen fades to white, a royal anticipation for the epic place.

#BGM Royal Fanfare

#TRANS Fade To White

== It Was Once Beautiful ==
Where: Castle Of Dawn
Summary: Claire walks into the Castle feeling a bit shaken. The moment of vulnerability and realness she just had felt so... real. This isn't a dream, is it? The thought of returning to the real world feels ever so dreadful, but what choice does she have. In the castle, Erica reveals she had been following her, and gives her a short tour of the once beautiful royal palace. After noting Claire's fright and disillusion, she vanishes into the catacombs.

#TRANS Dry cut
#BGM Overgrown

The pompous fanfare is stopped, jarringly, with the vision of the inner castle, overgrown with vines and flowers.
Everywhere, there's dust, debris, mold...

The only light in the castle is the late afternoon sun that casts long projections of the window frames.

// In the soundtrack, a few high, shy piano notes play, to score the scene. BOTW-esque.

Claire takes a few moments to look around.

There is a saving point here, its narration reads: "Somewhere inside the castle lies 'The Mirror,' your way home. With the thought of your bed... your SOUL glimmers with HOPE."

On the lower side of the staircase there's a mirror. Interacting with it, narration reads:

"It's a mirror!"

(APD) Claire goes up the left staircase. She takes a few steps, then an aracnisse will be startled.

[Castle Nisse]
Oh! Oh! Please be careful, human!

[Claire]
Huh? Who's talking?

[Castle Nisse]
Down here!

[Claire]
Aah. Sorry— you're just so tiny...
Are there a lot of your kind here?
I'll try to keep an eye out for you guys, okay?

[Castle Nisse]
Why, thank you!
Huh, how considerate of you... I appreciate it, really!
(!)
Wait a minute! It just hit me that you're a human!
Rarer sight every day on this side of reality.
Well, later!

Narration remarks "The Aracnisse crawls out of your way."

// Be nice to the nisser throughout the game, and they'll leave you extra items in cobwebs.

Claire goes up the stairs. The music picks up. Up there Erica seems to be waiting for her.

[Erica]
Hi!!!

[Claire]
Hm???
Oh, hi.
I thought you weren't allowed here?

[Erica]
Oh, yeah, haha... could you, uh, keep this between us?

[Claire]
Oh, okay.

A brief pause, Erica looking Claire's face.

[Erica]
What's wrong?

[Claire]
Wrong?

[Erica]
You look... despondent...
I think that's what this face means...

[Claire]
I...
I don't know why but...

Claire looks down into the castle, then up at the ceiling.
Then she looks down and brushes her left hand with her right hands thumb, feeling its texture.

[&]
I know this is a dream but... it all feels so real.

A brief pause...

[Claire]
This...
This isn't a dream, is it?

[Erica]
Whaaaat?
Oh, oh no.
Ha ha... why do humans always...
No, things are just fuzzy and weird here.

[Claire]
(looks at her worried and confused)
What... is "here" anyway?

Erica is facing away from Claire, shaking her hands in excitement.

[Erica]
(realising)
OH... OH MY HEAVENS!
(happy)
I get to mentor a HERO!

She turns to Claire.

[&]
Ahem.
Hey, uh...
I'll answer ALL your questions...
IF!!!
For every question I answer, you answer one of MINE back!

[Claire]
Uh... sure.

[Erica]
Okay, let's go!

[Claire]
So...
What is this place?

[Erica]
This is the royal castle...

[Claire]
No, I mean... this whole...

[Erica]
Oh. Right.
Well, you see...
There's *your side*... and then there's the other side...
Which is here.

[Claire]
The... dream world...?

[Erica]
I've never heard anyone call it that haha.
We call it "The Other Side."

[Claire]
You... call your own side "The Other Side"?

[Erica]
...
It literally never occurred to me that this is weird.

[Claire]
Heh...

[Erica]
No, like, we only call it that when we're talking to humans???
We don't need a term for it otherwise??? It's just??? The world???

A bit ahead, on the next room.

[Claire]
What is—

[Erica]
A bub bub bub!
It's my turn!

[Claire]
(smiling)
Oh, sorry! Shoot it.

[Erica]
What is school?

Claire blinks twice, being taken aback by the strange question.

[Claire]
It's a place you go to learn stuff... and also get bullied a lot apparently.

[Erica]
Huh! Why would you keep going?

[Claire]
Well, I mean, you have to.
It's, like, law, and stuff.
And Education.
Yea. Education is important.

[Erica]
Hmm...

[Claire]
What are you guys?
Are you... like... aliens?

[Erica]
What are aliens?

[Claire]
Creatures that aren't from Earth...

[Erica]
I guess I'm not from EARTH, so, sure!
What is grass?

[Claire]
You HAVE that here???

[Erica]
Huh?

[Claire]
It's the green stuff that grows from the ground.

[Erica]
Oh, yeah! Wait... that didn't count!
Hmm...
What... uh... happens when you gra... du... grad...

[Claire]
Graduate?

[Erica]
Yeah...

[Claire]
Well, you get a job...

[Erica]
Ooo... what's a job...

[Claire]
It's, like, a thing you gotta do so you get money.

[Erica]
I know what money is!
Do many people get jobs?

[Claire]
(smiling)
Everybody has to.
My dad works as a researcher... he's ALWAYS busy...
Spends the whole day... researching...
My other dad works as a therapist... he's always busy, but at home.
So I get to hear some gossip through the door.
(serious)
I could, but I don't.
That would be unethical.
He spends the whole day listening to people's stuff...

[Erica]
(preoccupied)
Doesn't that get tiring eventually?

[Claire]
Oh yeah.

[Erica]
(confused)
So why do they do it?

[Claire]
Well, we need to eat somehow...
Hey, this is MY turn!

[Erica]
(pensive)
Go on ahead, me fair lady arghhh—

[Claire]
Hm...
Wait... if I'm not on EARTH... does it mean I'm in space???

[Erica]
Ooo what's space?

[Claire]
Uhhh....

[Erica]
This is another realm, a distinct tridimensional continuum and spacetime fabric from EARTH's.
Yours is all stretchy and weird... it's woven all wonky donky...
I've been learning some sewing patterns that—

The two of them come to a new room of the castle.
There are tapestries hung on the walls with awe-inspiring images.

[Erica]
Look! It's EARTH!

[Claire]
Hm?

[Erica]
It's so blue...
Oh, and here! It's our golden tale!

Erica dashes out of frame, looking at the next tapestry.
(APD) Claire follows her.

// Interacting which each tapestry, a passage of the golden tale will be remarked.

// "EARTH."
// "HOPE."
// "DREAM."
// "PAIN."
// "PORTAL."

[Erica]
This one is my favourite.
"We hear their story... we hear their pain..."
"We make a **portal**"—
(proudly)
That's where I come in!
Or... will come in...

[Claire]
Oh right, you're training to be a...
You'll be the head of "kidnapping children for character development"...

[Erica]
Yes!!! Isn't it cool?

[Claire]
(awestruck)
This... really is another world...
I'm—
I'm sorry I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around...
(smiling)
Ha ha... This... all of this was here the whole time???
(serious)
Just... somewhere in the woods?

[Erica]
Oh! No, no. We open portals on a case by case basis...
Each portal is made for a human.
And then when the human's journey is over it closes itself shut.

[Claire]
Speaking of, can you show me where the mirror is?

[Erica]
Oh, I'm not allowed in the shrine.
They say it's for grownups only.
Oh. Aaaahh I just remembered my room is a mess!
I'll go clean it!!

[Claire]
Wait how do I get to the—

Erica runs out of frame again.

[&]
Aaaand she's gone.

(APD) You follow her to the next room.

== The Ruined Castle ==
Summary: Claire explores the castle on her own, running into scary dragons and dinky nisser. As she navigates the perilous rooms, she wonders what this kingdom could've been in its glory days.

When you walk there there's a big part of the castle and many enemies to fight.

#BGM Castle of Dawn (the song picks up)

#VS Castle Enemies (refer to note below)

// Okay, so, in this part of the castle there's lots of enemies and flavour text. There are three kinds of enemies, all much stronger than the ones outside, though all weaker than Basket Knight.
// 1. Dust Bunny — "An ephemeral fella, it's dirty, but loves to be pet Just Right."
// 1.1. You have to pet them "just right," which means hitting the "yellow" in the minigame and not red or green.
// 2. Bookwyrm — "This dragon hoards the richest treasure of all — knowledge!"
// 2.1. You can use 'Listen' several times to defeat them...
// 2.2. 'Nitpick' will make a Bookwyrm angry at you if you haven't Listen'd to them in a previous turn... If you've Listen'd to them before, you'll gain a lot of SPARE points the first time you nitpick. Nitpicking too much will make them sad though. "Listen + Nitpick + Listen" is the ideal strategy.
// 2.3. Using 'DREAM' after 'Listen' will make a science Bookwyrm offended at you, but will make a story Bookwyrm happy.
// 3. Aracnisse — A polite little spider. It respectfully borrows items forgotten by humans, and leaves then coins or dead insects in return.
// 3.2. You can offer them tea or trinkets to win immediately.
// 3.3. You can ACT "Not Step On" and they'll appreciate your politeness if you manage to not step on them, while also dodging the bullet patterns of the other characters lol.
// 4. Tometu — A dirty little thief! These naughty nisse love to prank humans, then steal their books!
// 4.1. Using 'Nitpick' will make them nitpick back at you, diminishing your DP.
// 4.2. You can ACT "Step On" after they prank you, and they will learn their lesson. Doing it too early won't work!!!

== Erica ==
Where: Aurora/Castle Of Dawn/Sleeping Quarters
Summary: Claire gets closer to the shrine, but her attention is grabbed by Erica, who wants to show Claire her room. She shows Claire all her human trinkets, souvenirs she kept from all the humans she has met in the past, as well as new items she acquired through Aracnisse, including a TV in which they watch a live broadcast of helicopters and personnel trying to rescue Andy and Bruno. Claire feels more like she has to go back. Erica runs out of the room suspisciously.

By walking around the winding staircases and corridors, you can find your way to the living quarters.

When you get there, Erica will come out of the room and (!) at your sight.

[Erica]
Oh, there you are.
I was gonna fetch you...
Did you have fun with the dragons?

Claire, looking all dirty and beat up replies:

[Claire]
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sure!

[Erica]
Wicked. Come in!

Claire comes into the room. It has a bed, some shelves and windows, and lots and lots of items and trinkets.

Erica is jumping at the bed.

[Erica]
Welcome to me room!!!

She stops jumping by letting herself fall on her back.
She stays laid down for a moment, then sits at the edge of the bed.

[Claire]
Woah... there's a lot of uh... stuff...

[Erica]
I know, right! Isn't it awesome?

[Claire]
I thought you were going to clean it?

[Erica]
I did!
Okay so do you want a tour?
We can do it museum style... you see what catches your attention and then I give additional context.

[Claire]
Additional context.

[Erica]
Oh, yeah, you'll probably know more about everything since you're the human expert.

You can interact with the many items around.

%IF interacting with the shelves...

[Erica]
You want thingamabobs? I got twenty or so.
I don't know what they're for but I can't have enough of 'em!

%IF interacting with the bed.

[Erica]
Don't get too comfy, this bed is for jumping only!
I'm not allowed to jump on my bed back home so I comandeered this one.

"There's some kind of travel backpack under the bed. You recall going hiking in the park as a kid."

%IF interacting with the wall.

[Erica]
(excited)
Ooh! So. My job used to be—
Uh, before *The Bleakness* made everything dead...
Whenever humans would come they would come all anxious.
That's what *the prince* told me...
So I would hang out with them and we'd play games for hours...
We'd tell jokes and laugh.
(proud)
And it'd make them better. I think.
At the end they always...
(sad)
Left...
(smiling)
Now all I have of that time is, yeah, that random pile of clothing acessories.
I didn't steal them, they just forgot them, okay?

"A pile of human items. Amongst them there is a sandal, an eraser and an asthma inhaler."

%IF interacting with the TV.

[Erica]
This is my TV!
Bought it from a nisse. Cost me a whole year of allowance...
T'was worth it, though, I love watching human shows.

[Claire]
Oh, you have some cassette tapes and stuff?

[Erica]
Huh?

[Claire]
Y'know, VHS? Uhh... Betamax?

[Erica]
I just watch the TV I guess.
Look, I'll show you.

Erica turns on the TV with a controller. The light of the tube fills the room with a serious glow.

[Erica]
Cool! Action movie!

[Claire]
Is that... the news???
Turn the volume up.

[Erica]
Wait!!! You can do that???

Claire takes the remote from her hand and sits on the bed.
Erica puts her head on Claire's shoulder. Claire readjusts and scooches a little to the right. Erica nearly falls, gets flustered and sits up straight.

From the TV you can hear helicopters and the wind.

[News Anchor]
...and so the search continues for the missing teenagers in the school...

[Erica]
Woah! That's so much better.

Claire stares at the TV, the seriety of the situation coming back to her.

[Claire]
That's... right now???

[Erica]
OH THATS THE NEWS?? I THOUGHT THAT—

Erica sees Claire being quiet and also gets quiet.

[News Anchor]
...rescue team is still trying to enter the building, with no success so far...
...CSIS agents and the federal police are setting up a perimeter, so we can't... (noise) ...more information at this moment, but we'll keep you updated...

Claire puts her forehead on her wrists.
She sighs.

[Claire]
They're not... gonna get in...
I've been there there's some kind of psychic... Ugh...

Erica gets up of the bed and scoots around. She gets a backpack filled with things, and some more items and discreetly leaves the room, without Claire noticing.

[Claire]
This... this sucks so much...
If all of this is true, I should be able to help them, right?
I got in and then out...
I guess with a portal I could...

Claire starts to breathe heavily.

[Claire]
And the Mirror can help me be less disoriented...

Then Erica leaves.

At player discretion, you can leave, too.
There are other rooms to explore, like the former prince's and a few more.

// In Prof. Whynott's room you can find some old inventions and a key to the basement of the castle.

== The Shrine Of Reflection ==
Where: Aurora/Castle Of Dawn/Mirror Shrine
Summary: Claire finds Erica again, but something about her humour has shifted. Erica reveals the true danger of Claire's situation and empathises with Claire's aprehension. As much as she wants to be the next seamstress Erica herself is scared of taking that role. She's scared of growing up. She's scared that everything will change. She had never known why kids fall into The Other Side and why they help them, but now she knows... EARTH must be a horrible place.

(APD) Claire goes up the stairs to the shrine. The music goes from silent to mysterious and ominous.

#BGM Shrine of Reflection

As she walks, several mirrors decorate the walls.

%IF you interact with any of them:

[Claire]
Is this the mirror?
...
I don't get it.

%FINALLY


[Erica]
(echoing)
You know... I always wondered why they came... and why they left...
What kind of place they've returned to...

The music gets louder and louder the deeper you go into the shrine. A voice echoes through the winding tower as if reflected by the mirrors.

[Erica]
(echoing)
When he told me we had to make them feel safe...
It gave me the impression.
EARTH... it's not a very kind place, is it?

Claire continues. The light becomes darker and more somber. Yet louder the music sounds.

[Erica]
There's so much the grownups don't tell you.
About your future. About the story. About **The Angel**.

Claire continues further, seeing a large door from which an eerie glow comes from. The music gets tenser.

[Erica]
(echoing)
Human. No... Hero of Spirit...
Right before you lies The Mirror.
And on the other side... your future...
Crossing this threshold, venturing deeper within yourself...
Solving the mystery behind that tear... Risking your life for it...
This is your destiny, isn't it?
And yet...

Walking a little more, Claire gets into [[The Mirror]]'s room. What looks like an enlarged hand mirror floats in the center of a hollow tower which walls are covered by shelves and shelves of books.

At the middle of [[The Mirror]], Erica is kneeling.

[Claire]
Erica?

With your back turned to you.

[Erica]
Do you want to go back there...

[Claire]
I...
Well, I'm not really looking forward to it, huh...

A brief pause.

[Claire]
B—

[Erica]
That's okay.
(smile)
I've worked something out.
You... me...
(excited)
Let's run away together!
To some place far far away!

Claire stops.

[Erica]
I know, there's some kinks to work out, but,
I've been thinking about this for a while...
We CAN get human food in here, and it doesn't spoil... and wherever you go the monsters can't find us...
There will be no bullies... and no grumpy adults telling us what to do...

[Claire]
Huh...?

[Erica]
You know how I'm training to be a Seamstress like Nana...
I really want to be one, but... thinking about how their lives are in my hand...
It makes me sick to my stomach.
So... I get you. I see that in you.
You don't really wanna do this, do you?
But you'll do it because you "have to."
Well...

Erica turns to you and smiles, brandishing a needle.

[Erica]
I won't let you do it.
I won't let you die.

== Let's Run Away Together ==
Where: Aurora/Castle Of Dawn/Mirror Shrine
Summary: Erica stands in Claire's way, dissuading her from leaving. From Erica's perspective, every human that has ever left has never come back, even their prince. In The Mirror room she sees herself reflected in Erica's fear of struggle and change, both now and in her own past. Seeing her own worries come from outside, coming from the mouth of a little girl, Claire understands what she must do. She must acknowldge her problems and choose to face them. Not deny them, not give in to hopelessness, but choose HOPE and choose to fight. Claire tells Erica of all that's _good_ about the world. Her friends, her family, all the things that make life worth living. She comforts Erica and tells her she'll do a good job. Erica cries, she doesn't want her to leave... but... she has to go, hasn't she? Erica lets go. Claire promises to return.

#VS Erica
#BGM Escapism

Battle.

[Erica]
They've been lying to you, you know...
This Mirror won't bring you home...

Erica throws needles at you.

[Erica]
They want you to go on an adventure.
The same kind we give the kids, that's what The Mirror does.
Then, you'll have your memories back... and you'll remember how to fix everything...

Erica attacks you. Claire dodges.

[Erica]
It all makes sense now.
They come hiding and we try to give them any warmth we can...
But it isn't enough... it never was...

[Claire]
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME????

[Erica]
I'm proving a point!
You think you can face any of that?
This should be nothing in comparison!

Erica does ballet moves, throwing needles at you (she throws two bunches, and you dodge by occupying the negative space).

[Erica]
And then they leave... they always do..
Even our prince, who I thought would stay... even he left.
And then they have never come back.

[Erica]
Claire, they reason why they hired you as a guide is...
If you go there alone...
You'll die.

Same move, slightly faster.

[Erica]
I shouldn't have but... I was curious and then I peeked.
Your life... your memories... your life isn't the happiest either, is it?

Same move, faster.

[Erica]
Do you understand?
Not remembering any of that... it's your second chance.
Or would you rather go home to the bullies... to the monsters...
That is, if you even get that far.
With so much sadness... so much pain...
If you go out through the mirror you could die.

Same move, much faster.

[Erica]
Why aren't you saying anything! Are you coming or not? Are you gonna stand there frozen? Mirror… Run away… There's only two options…

[Claire]
I... I don't know what to do...

%IF you haven't attacked so far:

[Erica]
Fight back!

[Claire]
What? No!

Same move, yet faster.

[Erica]
Is that what you plan to do out there?

[Claire]
I'm not gonna hit you???
You're just a girl!

[Erica]
So are you!

Same move, much faster.

[Erica]
You can't avoid this— you have to choose.

[Claire]
I... I...

Same move, the fastest and longest.

[Claire]
Erica, your family... your—
You shouldn't leave them behind...

[Erica]
Dodging the question, are we?
Try dodging *THIS*.

Erica charges a stack of needles. It ominously takes longer then usual, until another stack popus up leaving no room to avoid them in the bullet board. Then, suddenly, all of them turn purple and travel slowly toward her SOUL.

%IF You get hit by the "seemingly undodgeable" attack.

[Erica]
Answer me!
Sooner or later, you'll have to *face this problem head on*.

// The highlighted phrase is coloured in purple, Claire's SOUL's colour, hinting that you should dash through the bullets. If Claire dashes at any time while the bullets are purple, the bullets become semi-transparent by the duration of the dash.

%FINALLY

Here, the player must press Z to dash _through_ the bullets.

[Claire]
The story and... the tapestries... you showed them to me, right?
Don't they say I have to—

[Erica]
Some... flippin'... story they've told you???
Claire, I believe we can make our own story!
What story do *YOU* want to tell?

// The following attacks consist of patterns that require you to not passively avoid danger, but actively seek bullets to dash through.

Next turn, DREAM will be resonating (glowing rainbow) in your battle menu. Clicking it now diplays several different things to DREAM about.

Bullies.   Ice Cream.   Dad.
Dancing.   Rubble.      Hiking.

// Winning this battle, you must first dream of the bad things, then of the good things that make your life worth returning to. Only then, you stand firm in front of Erica as a hero.

Claire DREAMs of the bullies and all the pain she felt. Then, she dreams of going home to dad... of being hugged and held. She dreams of going for ice cream later... The DREAM menu stops resonating.

[Erica]
Why... would you want to return to a world that's hurt you so much...

[Claire]
There's... a lot of scary things down there...
But... there's a lot of good things, too...

[Erica]
...

Erica attacks you with little falling stars. Claire stands firm (ACT).

[Claire]
Erica.

Erica falters. Claire stands firm again (ACT).

[Claire]
Erica. Stop.

Erica shakes and cries. Claire stands firm once more (ACT).

[Claire]
Erica. It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.

Erica replies with a shaky voice.

[Erica]
I... don't want you to go...
I don't want this to change...
I thought you... understood me...

Erica stops attacking. Claire kneels and hugs her (ACT).

[Claire]
Hey... hey...
It's okay...

With the hug, the battle UI leaves, and the music goes silent.
Erica cries. The clouds outside dissipate, and sunlight peeks in.

Claire holds Erica in her arms as her knees weaken and she falls to the ground.

[Claire]
It's okay...
I'm gonna be okay...

[Erica]
W... what if I...
What if I can't do it...
What if I'm not strong like you are...

[Claire]
Erica.
You're a talented kid.
You nearly kicked my ass.

Erica laughs, then sniffles.

[Erica]
I'm...
Oh. Oh what am I doing.

Erica swallows her tears and dries her face with her sleeves.

[Erica]
Don't worry I will now Get Out Of Your Freaking Way...
Welp. This was silly.

Claire smiles kindly at her and touches her shoulder. Erica walks away from Claire, toward the door.

== The Aventure Starts ==
Where: Aurora/Castle Of Dawn/Mirror Shrine
Summary: Claire looks at the memories of her past she'll be diving back into, a period of her life she has since locked behind her. But she must do it, no, she wants to do it — to become herself again, to remember why she fights, to remember her power, to figure it out and save the world.

#BGM The Water's Fine

Erica walks towards the door. She hesitates, then turns around with her head down.

[Erica]
I'm... so sorry for right now...
We're not even really friends, we... just barely met...
I just thought...
Well, now you know I'm an idiot, haha...

%PROMPT "We're friends.", "Take care."

%IF you say "We're friends."

[Erica]
Oh...

She smiles to you, though she feels sad you're leaving.

[Erica]
Y'know, I don't know what half those things are...
EARTH.
Whatever you see in it... must be so beautiful if it makes up for all of this mess...
(down)
I guess this is goodbye then.

[Claire]
There's a portal in the forest, right?
I'll come back. Promise.

[Erica]
(down)
...

Erica breathes in as if summoning all her strength. Then she smiles.

[Erica]
(smiling)
I'm sorry for kicking you in the face.

[Claire]
...

%FINALLY

Erica walks away.

Claire turns around and looks down. Vague images are reflected in The Mirror of a past Claire has long compartmentalised away. Claire kneels.

Narration remarks: "Beyond this threshold lies your way home. But you feel as if your adventure is just about to begin. In your heart, a slightly more familiar feeling resonates."

Pressing Z to open the command menu shows "DREAM" glowing in rainbow colours, and confirming it unleashes Claire's will.

Summoning all her courage, Claire accepts her adventure ahead. Storm clouds gather around the tower, bursting the windows open. The room shakes, and the flames of the candles go out one by one. Wind blows Claire's hair.

The Mirror glows brighter and its lights are reflected in Claire's eyes. This is it.

[Claire]
I... I understand now...
Somehow... I stumbled upon this... world...
Or did I?
Either way...
This is something really important, isn't it?

[&]
(chuckling)
Heh. What the hell.
Whatever it is I have to do… Whatever it is I have to see…
Please… Open my eyes…

The music swells and The Mirror's glow fills the room.

#CHYRON Inner Voices.

Credits roll down.

== Post Credits ==
Where: New Horizon
Summary: In New Horizon, agents from the Memetics Insight and Neutralisation Division try to contact the Heroes inside the school and rescue them, to little success. One of the agents remarks how they shouldn't be worried, because if anyone knows how to deal with this kind of stuff it's Claire. One of the agents notifies a higher-up of the event, implying it might be of use to the government.

In darkness, we hear a passing conversation.

[Agent Weaver]
Any luck contacting the special agents?

#TRANS Slow fade in.
#CAM Pan down as the camera fades in, framing the agents in front of the school.

Agent Taylor and Agent Weaver are standing with two government trucks in front of the school. Piercing blue alarm lights ominously light the room. Agent Taylor is trying to call someone on the phone.

[Agent Taylor]
Bad news. Security footage from across the street — O'Connor, Brooks, Miller AND Carter are all in there.

[Agent Weaver]
Well, we were planing to send them in there anyways, so...

[Agent Taylor]
They must've had the initiative to investigate the event before it appeared in our radar...

[Agent Weaver]
That or got caught in it. Or they caused it. Just as likely for those kids.
Either way, if anyone can deal with that anomaly it's Claire Carter.

[Agent Taylor]
Really? Even after—

Agent Taylor's call comes through.

[Agent Taylor]
Hello? Oh yes, Dr. Fay, this is Agent Taylor from the Memetics Insight and Neutralisation Division...

[&]
...it appears to be a class four memetic incident, with a highly structured psycho-electric shield preventing the extraction of any samples.

[Agent Weaver]
(whispering)
Put it on speaker.

[Agent Taylor]
Shh.

[Dr. Fay]
(on speaker phone)
...let me get this right, agent, you called me to inform me on your failure at doing your job?

[Agent Taylor]
(smiling anticipating his boss' reaction)
A psycho-electric field with this level of complexity... four of the kids missing... completely gone... the 470 nm emission spectrum...
Dr., I think this might be what we've been looking for.

[Agent Weaver]
(in anticipation)
...
