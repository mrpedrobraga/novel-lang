-- That Rainy Night --
Cold open. A faint memory plays. It was a friday. It was raining. And you didn't yet know how much everything was going to change. In that one cold friday night. Intro chyron.

-- First Day of School --
We cut to a new scene. Claire is excited to move to a new school and make all sorts of new friends... but things from now on might not go as well as expected.

-- The Jumpcut --
Claire, Andy and Bruno wake up in the aftermath of... something. Their memories are spliced and jumbled, and they're surrounded by bizarre figures. After a few moments in hiding, Andy and Claire decide to step out and try to leave.

-- The Aftermath --
While walking around, Claire and Andy find a strange, glowing hole in the ground. The school patio shows signs of a struggle. Something happened in this place. Something really wrong. After getting the key, they are ready to leave, but they get cornered by the Twisted and Claire runs away, accidentally falling into the tear.

-- Shallow Wound --
Claire wakes up inside the tear and runs as fast as she can from the entranced children. She hides away in the bathroom, lacking the courage to jump from the window. Someone enters the bathroom, she thinks she's a goner... and then...

-- Mystery Encounter --
Exiting the bathroom stall, she's in a supernatural darkness. She's cornered by someone, oh no! Welp, you've been got! That's The Mystery Kid, incurable prankster and your saviour in times of despair — they offer Claire an all paid vacation trip to Hearthaven, away from the dangers of the world.

-- The Portal --
Claire walks through the sombre forest, trying to find her way out. She follows a small black cat into the woods and down the creeks until she sees an abandoned treehouse. When she opens its door she's surprised by a portal to another world.

-- In Hearth A Haven --
In The Other Side, Claire is amazed at the sights of the city. The inhabitants quickly take notice of the foreigner and receive her warmly. The adults are unsure of what to do next, and she's summoned to the Mayor's Office.

-- Political Favour --
The town adults discuss the presence of the hero in her state. Claire offers to fetch "The Ancient Scroll" in time for the storytelling ceremony.

-- Steamy Battle --
At Prof. Whynott's Atelier, one of his projects has gone haywire! Claire helps neutralise the rather unperilous threat and retrieves the stories.

-- The Story --
Claire brings the stories back to the mayor hall. Claire participates in the town's evening communal storytelling event and learns about her own role as The Hero of Spirit! This is a warm little village, she could stay here forever. Not really, though, and the elder urges her to leave to The Mirror to recover from the incident.

-- A Dream Come True --
Erica, one of the children townsfolk bonds with Claire on the roof. Claire is urged to leave the town in a small quest towards the Mirror. She's unsure of what lies up ahead.

-- The Journey Starts --
Claire and Prof. Whynott set out on their expedition. This place is eerie, but she won't have to go through all of it alone.

-- A Hesitation --
Nevermind. The train gets to Aurora and while the sights are incredible, The Bleakness makes itself felt with the presence of corrupted Somni. Bleaked wasps attack the tram. Claire hesitates to jump, which costs the Professor's chance at an escape.

-- DREAM my own dream --
Claire's alone. The gray sky pours endlessly, weighing her down. She reflects on everything that has happened so far. She feels scared and hopeless and small. But... what's that? A small but bright flame glows within her still. Claire chooses to DREAM her own dream, to think positively and not think about all the messed up things that are happening. In resonance, the sky opens and sunlight peeks through. With DREAM power, Claire brings fleeting life into the city of statues and ruin.

-- The Ruined City --
Claire navigates through the city, bringing life wherever she goes with the power of her DREAM. She can feel herself connecting to her inner Hero already, kindly helping Somni in the city.

-- The Garden Gate --
Claire approaches the thresholds of the kingdom, her way out of this otherworld. A dog guard judges her character by giving her a test. She passes, but, oh, no... It seems the life she has brought into the city didn't last very long. Rushing in comes the clouds and takes everything away. Claire puts on a smile and chooses to go on.

-- The Garden --
At the heart of the ruined city, a garden lies surprisingly well-kept. What a delightful place to be in. Basket Knight, the groundskeeper is skeptical of you but chooses to help you— oh, oh no, why did you have to step on the bloody grass???

-- The Garden (Chess Encounter) --
Within the garden, some ruined knights walk about. They're corrupted but, they're soothed. Perhaps it's the sweet aroma of the flowers? These three nerd knights lightly harass you with their chess kerfuffle.

-- The Basket Knight --
And then comes Basket Knight who hates your guts and vows to kill you, all throughout resulting in mild inconvenience. Claire responds with positivity and politeness, making BK absolutely livid.

-- Mad Tea Party --
A true respite within the ruins. Some corrupted cityfolk enjoy delicious human tea. You may have some yourself. What? You're on danger of being impaled and killed??? That's no reason to interrupt their tea time, silly!

-- Basket Knight Is At It Again --
The Basket Knight is at it again!

-- Truce and Lull --
Claire and Basket Knight catch their breath after fighting against more ruined knights and watching the bees get unleashed into the garden. They get inside, drink some warm tea and talk about their situations. Maybe the human isn't so bad after all...

-- The Price Paid --
Claire's hesitance back in the tram had consequences. From the woods, emerges a corrupted Prof. Whynott, the Knight's creator, who "attacks" the girls. Basket Knight remembers why she despises the humans so much.

-- Versus The Basket Knight --
Claire fights The Basket Knight, who tries to aggressively kill you with flower petals. She hates how fake and dishonest humans are. How they do horrible things and lie to themselves to justify their wrongdoings. Claire must drop her façade and admit to her anxiety and dismay, the emotional honesty gaining Basket Knight's trust.

-- It Was Once Beautiful --
Claire walks into the Castle feeling a bit shaken. The moment of vulnerability and realness she just had felt so... real. This isn't a dream, is it? The thought of returning to the real world feels ever so dreadful, but what choice does she have. In the castle, Erica reveals she had been following her, and gives her a short tour of the once beautiful royal palace. After noting Claire's fright and disillusion, she vanishes into the catacombs.

-- The Ruined Castle --
Claire explores the castle on her own, running into scary dragons and dinky nisser. As she navigates the perilous rooms, she wonders what this kingdom could've been in its glory days.

-- The Shrine Of Reflection --
Claire finds Erica again, but something about her humour has shifted. Erica reveals the true danger of Claire's situation and empathises with Claire's aprehension. As much as she wants to be the next seamstress Erica herself is scared of taking that role. She's scared of growing up. She's scared that everything will change. She had never known why kids fall into The Other Side and why they help them, but now she knows... EARTH must be a horrible place.

-- Let's Run Away Together --
Erica stands in Claire's way, dissuading her from leaving. From Erica's perspective, every human that has ever left has never come back, even their prince. In The Mirror room she sees herself reflected in Erica's fear of struggle and change, both now and in her own past. Seeing her own worries come from outside, coming from the mouth of a little girl, Claire understands what she must do. She must acknowldge her problems and choose to face them. Not deny them, not give in to hopelessness, but choose HOPE and choose to fight. Claire tells Erica of all that's _good_ about the world. Her friends, her family, all the things that make life worth living. She comforts Erica and tells her she'll do a good job. Erica cries, she doesn't want her to leave... but... she has to go, hasn't she? Erica lets go. Claire promises to return.

-- The Aventure Starts --
Claire looks at the memories of her past she'll be diving back into, a period of her life she has since locked behind her. But she must do it, no, she wants to do it — to become herself again, to remember why she fights, to remember her power, to figure it out and save the world.

-- Post Credits --
In New Horizon, agents from the Memetics Insight and Neutralisation Division try to contact the Heroes inside the school and rescue them, to little success. One of the agents remarks how they shouldn't be worried, because if anyone knows how to deal with this kind of stuff it's Claire. One of the agents notifies a higher-up of the event, implying it might be of use to the government.
