T: INNER VOICES 01
S: The Mystery Kid Encounter

== Entrance ==
Where: ??? / Void Room

[Claire]
Yeah, I don't dig rooms which are pitch black and have no walls.

== Prank ==

[Voice]
Poor thing.
Lost, confused...
And yet, I must say...
You ARE a brave little girl.
You have fared well thus far.
Too bad though, you have committed a grave mistake.
Stepping into the shadows in this manner.
And, now, you must pay for it.
With your **SOUL**.

She's surrounded by cards.  

[&]
G o o d b y e!  

The cards approach her and the screen goes black.

#VFX A giant "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA" sweeps across the screen.

[Pierre]
Meow! You were right, boss!
That was PRICELESS!

[The Mystery Kid]
And I thought it was going to be too corny!
But it WAS quite funny yeah!

[Pierre]
Look at her, she's shaking like a deer!

[Claire]
Aaaaaaaaaaaa

[The Mystery Kid]
Chillax mate!
It ain't US who's gonna kill ya!
In fact, we're here to help ya, darlin'

[Claire]
Oh... thank goodness.
Please don't do that ever again.
You started saying all those things and-
Why, you're just a little kid-

[The Mystery Kid]
Hey! I'm older than I look.
Ah, oh, it IS all true, in a way.
You must've noticed that everything outside is kinda...
Different. Gnarly even.
It's all a horrendous shade of dark blue!
I dig the glow-in-the-dark plants but the corrupted teenagers are a bit of a dealbreaker, right?
Pr'tty nasty if you ask me!

[Claire]
Do you know what hap-

[The Mystery Kid]
Oh, this is all because of yesterday!
You don't remember?
Well, something happened that "broke" the world.
(serious)
Everyone's memories were damaged... the space time in here is shattered.
It's like everything is.
(laugh)
Fragmented!

[&]
(smile)
And yeah it's your job to fix it.

[Claire]
What??? How???

[The Mystery Kid]
Goodness, you really don't remember anything?
Well, don't worry, it's okay to worry!
But think like that, you did quite good in getting to here, didn't ya?
You didn't even die once!

[Claire]
I... I don't know what's happening!
I'm probably not the person you're looking for-
I just want to go home.

[The Mystery Kid]
Ehhif you're put off by the paranormal you might not enjoy "home" right now.
Oh, what if I told you I knew a place...
Where you could take five, catch your breath, and then we talk more about it?
What'd ya think of that?

[The Mystery Kid]
So, do we have... a deal?

When they say "deal" the room goes ominous and their hand lights on fire.

[&]
What's the holdup? Afraid of a handshake?

[Claire]
I'm not touching that!
Your hand is on fire!

[The Mystery Kid]
It's.. it's... it's magic fire. It's cool.

[Claire]
Okay...

They slowly shake hands, TMK staring into her eyes.

[The Mystery Kid]
Okay so that handshake has zero legal binding so you gotta sign this contract.
Do you have a pen on you?

[Claire]
No.

[The Mystery Kid]
Are you sure???
Check your ear!

[Claire]
Hmm... huh...

[The Mystery Kid]
Yep, looks like you really don't have one.
You can use mine though.
Sign here... and here...
Okay, Claire, you are terrific!
Hey, don't worry! You'll be back home before you can count to three.
Just, uh, don't start counting now.

[Claire]
You really... think I'm the person to fix this?

[The Mystery Kid]
(smile)
Claire, you're the PERFECT person for this job.
And Pierre, the cat, will be the PERFECT companion, offering incidental support.

[Pierre]
Didn't you mean to say... "Purrfect"?

[The Mystery Kid]
(smile)
No I did not!

[Claire]
Okay...

[The Mystery Kid]
And you'll be home before you know it, luv!
But, now, it's time to get you to [important]the other side[/important].
The way home might be dangerous... and a bit chilly, but, what the heck!
You can do it, I know it!
There's an 100% chance that you'll maybe survive!
And remember, we're all counting on ya.
Cheerios.

The entire table with Mystery Kid and Pi√©rre float up  
with a comedic whistle noise.

== Mirror ==
It's you... NOT!
The mirror is too matte to see anything.

== Boombox ==
It's a boom... paralelepiped?

== Spilled Coffee 1 ==
Caution. The floor is coffee'd.

== Spilled Coffee 2 ==
No use crying over spilled coffee.

== Clothes Rack 1 ==
Several glimmering black suits with red-and-blue bowties.

== Clothes Rack 2 ==
It's not yet time for you to wear a suit.

== VHS ==
A stack of video-cassetes.
It seems like it consists of sitcoms, but spliced to contain only the laugh tracks.

== Garbage 1 ==
Ew, it's trash.

== Garbage 2 ==
If the trash can, so can you!

== Papers 1 ==
It's several pages of paper written on with glitter pens.
In it, alternate scripts for this very encounter.
...and a bunch of drawings of people in elaborate suits.

== Papers 2 ==
One of the papers catches your eyes.
It reads: "Stop looking at my stuff and get out already!"
